"A pornographic actor or actress or a porn star is a person who performs sex acts in film , normally characterised as a pornographic film ."
Pornographic films tend to be made in a number of distinct pornographic sub-genres and attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create or fit that fantasy .
"Depending on the genre of the film , the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance ."

"Most male performers in heterosexual pornography are generally selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess , namely their ability to do three things : achieve an erection while on a busy film set , maintain that erection while performing on camera , and then ejaculate on cue ."
"The pornography industry in the United States was the first to develop a star system , especially for commercial reasons ."

The United States public debt is the money borrowed by the federal government of the United States through the issuing of securities by the Treasury and other federal government agencies .
US public debt consists of two components:
"Debt held by the public includes Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government , including that held by individuals , corporations , the Federal Reserve System and foreign , state and local governments ."
"Debt held by government accounts or intragovernmental debt includes non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts administered by the federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries , such as the Social Security Trust Fund ."
"Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses , including interest earnings , of these accounts that have been invested in Treasury securities ."
Public debt increases or decreases as a result of the annual unified budget deficit or surplus .
"The federal government budget deficit or surplus is the difference between government receipts and spending , ignoring intra-governmental transfers ."
"However , some spending that is excluded from the deficit ( supplemental appropriations ) also adds to the debt ."
"Historically , the US public debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions , and subsequently declined ."
"For example , debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II ( 113 % of GDP in 1945 ) , but then fell over the following 30 years ."
"In recent decades , however , large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government 's fiscal policies ."
"On 2 April 2013 , debt held by the public was approximately $ 11.959 trillion or about 75 % of GDP ."
"Intragovernmental holdings stood at $ 4.846 trillion , giving a combined total public debt of $ 16.805 trillion ."
"As of January 2013 , $ 5.6 trillion or approximately 47 % of the debt held by the public was owned by foreign investors , the largest of which were the People 's Republic of China and Japan at just over $ 1.1 trillion each ."
"Athenian democracy developed in the Greek city-state of Athens , comprising the central city-state of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica , around 550 BC ."
Athens is one of the first known democracies .
"Other Greek cities set up democracies , and even though most followed an Athenian model , none were as powerful , stable , nor as well-documented as that of Athens ."
"It remains a unique and intriguing experiment in direct democracy , a political system in which the people do not elect representatives to vote on their behalf but vote on legislation and executive bills in their own right ."
"Participation was by no means open , but the in-group of participants was constituted with no reference to economic class and they participated on a large scale ."
The public opinion of voters was remarkably influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theatres .
"Solon ( 594 BC ) , Cleisthenes ( 508/7 BC ) , and Ephialtes ( 462 BC ) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy creating new institutions ."
"The greatest and longest lasting democratic leader was Pericles ; after his death , Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolution towards the end of the Peloponnesian War ."
It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides ; the most detailed accounts are of this fourth-century modification rather than the Periclean system .
It was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC .
"The Athenian institutions were later revived , but the extent to which they were a real democracy is debatable ."
"Owls are a group of birds that belong to the order Strigiformes , constituting 200 extant bird of prey species ."
"Most are solitary and nocturnal , with some exceptions ( e.g. , the Northern Hawk Owl ) ."
"Owls hunt mostly small mammals , insects , and other birds , although a few species specialize in hunting fish ."
"They are found in all regions of the Earth except Antarctica , most of Greenland and some remote islands ."
"Owls are characterized by their small beaks and wide faces , and are divided into two families : the typical owls , Strigidae ; and the barn-owls , Tytonidae ."

"The modern Olympic Games ( , JO ) is the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes participate in a variety of competitions ."
The Olympic Games are considered to be the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating .
"The Olympic Games are held quadrennially , ( every four years ) with the Summer and Winter Games alternating , meaning they each occur every four years but two years apart ."
"Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD ."
Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 .
"The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority ."
The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games .
"Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Games for ice and winter sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes ."
"The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements ."
"As a result , the Olympics shifted away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allow participation of professional athletes ."
The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games .
"World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916 , 1940 , and 1944 Games ."
Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games .
"The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations ( IFs ) , National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) , and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games ."
"As the decision-making body , the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each celebration of the Games ."
The host city is responsible for organizing and funding the Games consistent with the Olympic Charter .
"The Olympic program , consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games , is also determined by the IOC ."
"There are several Olympic rituals and symbols , such as the Olympic flag and torch , as well as the opening and closing ceremonies ."
"Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer Olympic Games and Winter Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events ."
"The first , second , and third place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals : gold , silver , and bronze , respectively ."
The Games have grown in scale to the point that nearly every nation is represented .
"Such growth has created numerous challenges , including boycotts , doping , bribery , and acts of terrorism ."
"Every two years , the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national , and sometimes international fame ."
The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world .
Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm originating from transformed cells arising in tissues forming the pancreas .
"The most common type of pancreatic cancer , accounting for 95 % of these tumors , is adenocarcinoma ( tumors exhibiting glandular architecture on light microscopy ) arising within the exocrine component of the pancreas ."
"A minority arise from islet cells , and are classified as neuroendocrine tumors ."
"The signs and symptoms that eventually lead to the diagnosis depend on the location , the size , and the tissue type of the tumor , and may include abdominal pain , lower back pain , and jaundice ( if the tumor compresses the bile duct ) ."
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the eighth worldwide .
"Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis : for all stages combined , the 1- and 5-year relative survival rates are 25 % and 6 % , respectively ; for local disease the 5-year survival is approximately 20 % while the median survival for locally advanced and for metastatic disease , which collectively represent over 80 % of individuals , is about 10 and 6 months respectively.Individuals vary , however - some are only diagnosed when they are terminally ill already and therefore only have a few days or weeks ."
Others have slower progression and may live a couple of years even if surgery is not possible .
Biblical judges
"A biblical judge ( Hebrew : shôphaatîm or shoftim שופטים ) is `` a ruler or a military leader , as well as someone who presided over legal hearings . ''"
"Following the conquest of Canaan by Joshua until the formation of the first Kingdom of Israel ( ca . 1150-1025 BC ) , the Israelite Tribes formed a loose confederation ."
"No central government existed in this confederation and in times of crisis , the people were led by ad hoc leaders known as judges ."
"Roger Keith `` Syd '' Barrett ( 6 January 1946 – 7 July 2006 ) was an English singer , songwriter , guitarist , and painter , best remembered as a founder member of the band Pink Floyd ."
"He was the lead vocalist , guitarist , and primary songwriter during the band 's psychedelic years , providing major musical and stylistic direction in their early work : he is credited with creating their name ."
"Barrett left the group in April 1968 amid speculations of mental illness exacerbated by drug use , and was briefly hospitalised ."
"He was active musically for ten years , recording with Pink Floyd four singles , the debut album ( and contributing to the second one ) , plus several unreleased songs ."
"In 1969 , Barrett started off a solo career with the release of the single , `` Octopus `` , which foreshadowed his first solo album , The Madcap Laughs ( 1970 ) , which was recorded over the course of one year ( 1968–1969 ) with four different producers ( Peter Jenner , Malcolm Jones , David Gilmour , and Roger Waters ) ."
"Nearly two months after Madcap was released , Barrett began working on his second – and last – album , Barrett ( produced by Gilmour , and featuring contributions from Richard Wright ) , which would be released in late 1970 , before going into self-imposed seclusion lasting until his death in 2006 ."
"In 1988 , an album of unreleased tracks/alternate takes , Opel , was released by EMI with Barrett 's approval ."
"Barrett 's innovative guitar work and exploration of experimental techniques such as using dissonance , distortion , and feedback had an enormous legacy , with a wide variety of musicians from David Bowie to Brian Eno to Jimmy Page and more drawing influence ."
"In his post-musician life , Barrett continued with his painting and dedicated himself to gardening , never to return to the public eye ."
He died in 2006 .
"A number of biographies have been written about him since the 1980s , and Pink Floyd wrote and recorded several tributes to him after he left , most notably the 1975 album Wish You Were Here ."
"The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist bomb attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19 , 1995 ."
"It would remain the most destructive act of terrorism on American soil until the September 11 , 2001 attacks ."
"The Oklahoma blast claimed 168 lives , including 19 children under the age of 6 , and injured more than 680 people ."
"The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a sixteen-block radius , destroyed or burned 86 cars , and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings ."
The bomb was estimated to have caused at least $ 652 million worth of damage .
"Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local , state , federal , and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing , and substantial donations were received from across the country ."
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces , consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations ."
"Within 90 minutes of the explosion , Timothy McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon ."
"Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Terry Nichols to the attack ; Nichols was arrested , and within days both were charged ."
Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices .
"McVeigh , an American militia movement sympathizer who was a Gulf War veteran , had detonated an explosive-filled Ryder rental truck parked in front of the building ."
"McVeigh 's co-conspirator , Terry Nichols , had assisted in the bomb preparation ."
"Motivated by his hatred of the federal government and angered by what he perceived as its mishandling of the Waco Siege ( 1993 ) and the Ruby Ridge incident ( 1992 ) , McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at Waco ."
"The official investigation , known as `` OKBOMB '' , was the largest criminal investigation case in American history ; FBI agents conducted 28,000 interviews , amassing of evidence , and collected nearly one billion pieces of information ."
The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997 .
"McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11 , 2001 , and Nichols was sentenced to life in prison ."
"Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols ; Michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the U.S. government , and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony ."
"As with other large-scale terrorist attacks , conspiracy theories dispute the official claims and allege the involvement of additional perpetrators ."
"As a result of the bombing , the U.S. government passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States , as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks ."
"On April 19 , 2000 , the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building , commemorating the victims of the bombing ."
Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the original explosion occurred .
"In American mathematics education , precalculus ( or Algebra 3 in some areas ) , is an advanced form of secondary school algebra , and a foundational mathematical discipline ."
It is also called Introduction to Analysis .
"In many schools , precalculus is actually two separate courses : Algebra and Trigonometry ."
Precalculus prepares students for calculus the same way as pre-algebra prepares students for Algebra I .
"While pre-algebra teaches students many different fundamental algebra topics , precalculus does not involve calculus , but explores topics that will be applied in calculus ."
It often involves covering algebraic topics that might not have been given attention in earlier algebra courses .
Some precalculus courses might differ with others in terms of content .
"For example , an honors level course might spend more time on conic sections , vectors , and other topics needed for calculus , used in fields such as medicine or engineering ."
"A college prepatory class might focus on topics used in business-related careers , such as matrices , or power functions ."
"In detail , precalculus deals with:"
Sets
Real numbers
Complex numbers
Solving inequalities and equations
Properties of functions
Composite functions
Polynomial functions
Rational functions
Trigonometry
Trigonometric functions and their inverses
Trigonometric identities
Conic sections
Exponential functions
Logarithmic functions

"Various cells and batteries ( top-left to bottom-right ) : two AA , one D , one handheld ham radio battery , two 9-volt ( PP3 ) , two AAA , one C , one camcorder battery , one cordless phone battery ."
"In electricity , a battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy ."
"Since the invention of the first battery ( or `` voltaic pile `` ) in 1800 by Alessandro Volta and especially since the technically improved Daniell cell in 1836 , batteries have become a common power source for many household and industrial applications ."
"According to a 2005 estimate , the worldwide battery industry generates US $ 48 billion in sales each year , with 6 % annual growth ."
"There are two types of batteries : primary batteries ( disposable batteries ) , which are designed to be used once and discarded , and secondary batteries ( rechargeable batteries ) , which are designed to be recharged and used multiple times ."
"Batteries come in many sizes , from miniature cells used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers ."

Northern California is the northern portion of the U.S. state of California .
"The San Francisco Bay Area ( which includes the cities of San Francisco , Oakland , and San Jose ) , and Sacramento ( the state capital ) as well as its metropolitan area are the main population centers ."
"It also contains redwood forests , along with the Sierra Nevada including Yosemite Valley and part of Lake Tahoe , Mount Shasta ( the second-highest peak in the Cascade Range after Mount Rainier in Washington ) , and the northern half of the Central Valley , one of the world 's most productive agricultural regions ."
"The area also contains one of the 11 megaregions of the United States , spanning from the San Francisco Bay Area east to the Lake Tahoe - Reno area , and from Metropolitan Fresno north to Greater Sacramento ."
"Native Americans arrived in Northern California at least as early as 8,000 to 5,000 BC and perhaps even much earlier , and successive waves of arrivals led to one of the most densely populated areas of pre-Columbian North America ."
"The arrival of European explorers from the early 16th to the mid-18th centuries , did not establish European settlements in Northern California ."
"In 1770 , the Spanish mission at Monterey was the first European settlement in the area , followed by other missions along the coast—eventually extending as far north as Sonoma County ."

"Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , also known as `` disseminated sclerosis '' or `` encephalomyelitis disseminata '' , is an inflammatory disease in which the fatty myelin sheaths around the axons of the brain and spinal cord are damaged , leading to demyelination and scarring as well as a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms ."
"Disease onset usually occurs in young adults , and it is more common in women ."
"It has a prevalence that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100,000 ."
MS was first described in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot .
MS affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to communicate with each other effectively .
"Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals called action potentials down long fibers called axons , which are contained within an insulating substance called myelin ."
"In MS , the body 's own immune system attacks and damages the myelin ."
"When myelin is lost , the axons can no longer effectively conduct signals ."
"The name multiple sclerosis refers to scars ( sclerae-—better known as plaques or lesions ) particularly in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord , which is mainly composed of myelin ."
"Although much is known about the mechanisms involved in the disease process , the cause remains unknown ."
Theories include genetics or infections .
Different environmental risk factors have also been found .
"Almost any neurological symptom can appear with the disease , and the disease often progresses to physical and cognitive disability ."
"MS takes several forms , with new symptoms occurring either in discrete attacks ( relapsing forms ) or accumulating over time ( progressive forms ) ."
"Between attacks , symptoms may go away completely , but permanent neurological deficits often occur , especially as the disease advances ."
There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis .
"Treatments attempt to return function after an attack , prevent new attacks , and prevent disability ."
"MS medications can have adverse effects or be poorly tolerated , and many people pursue alternative treatments , despite the lack of supporting scientific study ."
"The prognosis is difficult to predict ; it depends on the subtype of the disease , the individual 's disease characteristics , the initial symptoms and the degree of disability the person experiences as time advances ."
Life expectancy of people with MS is 5 to 10 years lower than that of the unaffected population .
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System .
It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth that of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined .
"Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn , Uranus and Neptune ."
"Together , these four planets are sometimes referred to as the or outer planets ."
"The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times , and was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures ."
The Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter .
"When viewed from Earth , Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94 , making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus ."
( Mars can briefly match Jupiter 's brightness at certain points in its orbit . )
"Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium , although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules ."
"It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements , but like the other gas giants , Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface ."
"Because of its rapid rotation , the planet 's shape is that of an oblate spheroid ( it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator ) ."
"The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes , resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries ."
"A prominent result is the Great Red Spot , a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope ."
Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere .
"There are also at least 67 moons , including the four large moons called the Galilean moons that were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 ."
"Ganymede , the largest of these moons , has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury ."
"Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft , most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter ."
The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto -bound New Horizons spacecraft in late February 2007 .
The probe used the gravity from Jupiter to increase its speed .
Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon Europa .

"Little League , Wayne , Michigan"
"Little League Baseball and Softball ( officially , Little League Baseball , Incorporated ) is a non-profit organization in South Williamsport , Pennsylvania , United States which organizes local youth baseball and softball leagues throughout the U.S. and the rest of the world ."
"Founded by Carl Stotz in 1939 as a three- team league in Williamsport , Pennsylvania , Little League Baseball encourages local volunteers to organize and operate Little League programs that are annually chartered through Little League International ."
Each league can structure itself to best serve the children in the area in which the league operates .
Several specific divisions of Little League baseball and softball are available to children ages 4 to 18 .
The organization holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code .
The organization 's administrative office is located in South Williamsport .
The first Little League Baseball World Series was played in Williamsport in 1947 .
"The Little League International Complex hosts the annual Little League Baseball World Series at Howard J. Lamade Stadium and Little League Volunteer Stadium , and is also the site of the Peter J. McGovern Little League Museum , which provides a history of Little League Baseball and Softball through interactive exhibits for children ."
"Clarence Anicholas Clemons , Jr. ( January 11 , 1942 – June 18 , 2011 ) , also known as The Big Man , was an American musician and actor ."
"From 1972 until his death , he was a prominent member of Bruce Springsteen 's E Street Band , playing the tenor saxophone ."
"He released several solo albums and in 1985 , had a hit single with `` You 're a Friend of Mine `` , a duet with Jackson Browne ."
As a guest musician he also featured on Aretha Franklin 's classic `` Freeway of Love `` and on Twisted Sister 's `` Be Chrool to Your Scuel `` as well as performing in concert with The Grateful Dead and Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band .
"As an actor Clemons featured in several films , including New York , New York and Bill & Ted 's Excellent Adventure ."
"He also made cameo appearances in several TV series , including Diff'rent Strokes , Nash Bridges , The Simpsons and The Wire ."
"Together with his television writer friend Don Reo he published his semi-fictional autobiography told in third person , Big Man : Real Life & Tall Tales , in 2009 ."

A teleconverter attached between a camera and its objective
An Olympus EC-20 - 2x teleconverter lens attached between a camera.1 - Camera lens 2 - Teleconverter 3 - Camera body
A teleconverter ( sometimes called tele extender ) is a secondary lens which is mounted between the camera and a photographic lens .
Its job is to enlarge the central part of an image obtained by the objective lens .
"For example , a 2× teleconverter for a 35 mm camera enlarges the central 12×18 mm part of an image to the size of 24×36 mm in the standard 35 mm film format ."
"Teleconverters are typically made in 1.4× , 1.7× , 2× and 3× models , of which 1.4× and 2× are most common ."
The use of a 2× teleconverter gives the effect of using a lens with twice the focal length .
It also decreases the intensity of the light reaching the film by a factor of 4 ( an equivalent of doubling the focal ratio ) as well as the resolution ( by a factor of 2 ) .
Illustration of a Eukaryotic cell membrane
The cell membrane is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment .
The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells .
The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings .
It consists of the lipid bilayer with embedded proteins .
"Cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion , ion conductivity and cell signaling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures , including the cell wall , glycocalyx , and intracellular cytoskeleton ."
Cell membranes can be artificially reassembled .
"The Late Heavy Bombardment ( commonly referred to as the lunar cataclysm , or LHB ) is a hypothetical event around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago ( Ga ) ."
"During this event a very large number of the impact craters on the Moon would have formed , and by inference on Earth , Mercury , Venus and Mars as well ."
"( While the LHB is `` late '' in the Solar System 's accretion period when Earth and the other rocky planets formed and gained most of their mass , it is early in Solar System history . )"
"The evidence for this event comes primarily from the dating of lunar samples brought back by the Apollo astronauts , which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed in this rather narrow interval of time ."
"While many hypotheses have been put forth to explain a spike in the flux of asteroids or comets in the inner Solar System at this time , no consensus yet exists as to its cause ."
"The Nice model , popular among planetary scientists , postulates that the gas giant planets underwent orbital migration and forced objects in the asteroid belt and/or Kuiper belt on eccentric orbits that put them in the path of the terrestrial planets ."
"Nevertheless , some researchers argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 Ga , and that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling material affected by a single large impact basin ."

Double rainbow and supernumerary rainbows on the inside of the primary arc .
The shadow of the photographer 's head on the bottom marks the centre of the rainbow circle ( antisolar point ) .
"A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection of light in water droplets in the Earth 's atmosphere , resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky ."
It takes the form of a multicoloured arc .
Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun .
"In a `` primary rainbow '' , the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side ."
"This rainbow is caused by light being refracted while entering a droplet of water , then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it ."
"In a double rainbow , a second arc is seen outside the primary arc , and has the order of its colours reversed , red facing toward the other one , in both rainbows ."
This second rainbow is caused by light reflecting twice inside water droplets .
"The Federal Reserve System ( also known as the Federal Reserve , and informally as the Fed ) is the central banking system of the United States ."
"It was created on December 23 , 1913 , with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act , largely in response to a series of financial panics , particularly a severe panic in 1907 ."
"Over time , the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure has evolved ."
Events such as the Great Depression were major factors leading to changes in the system .
"The US Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act : Maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long-term interest rates ."
The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve 's dual mandate .
"Its duties have expanded over the years , and today , according to official Federal Reserve documentation , include conducting the nation 's monetary policy , supervising and regulating banking institutions , maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions , the U.S. government , and foreign official institutions ."
"The Fed also conducts research into the economy and releases numerous publications , such as the Beige Book ."
"The Federal Reserve System 's structure is composed of the presidentially appointed Board of Governors ( or Federal Reserve Board ) , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation , numerous privately owned U.S. member banks and various advisory councils ."
"The FOMC is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents , though only five bank presidents vote at any given time ( the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms ) ."
"The Federal Reserve System has both private and public components , and was designed to serve the interests of both the general public and private bankers ."
The result is a structure that is considered unique among central banks .
"It is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank , namely the United States Department of the Treasury , creates the currency used ."
"According to the Board of Governors , the Federal Reserve System `` is considered an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government , it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress , and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms . ''"
The authority of the Federal Reserve System is derived from statutes enacted by the U.S. Congress and the System is subject to congressional oversight .
"The members of the Board of Governors , including its chairman and vice-chairman , are chosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate ."
The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the system 's highest-level employees .
Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their region ; this entitles them to elect some of the members of the board of the regional Federal Reserve Bank .
Thus the Federal Reserve system has both public and private aspects .
"The U.S. Government receives all of the system 's annual profits , after a statutory dividend of 6 % on member banks ' capital investment is paid , and an account surplus is maintained ."
"In 2010 , the Federal Reserve made a profit of $ 82 billion and transferred $ 79 billion to the U.S. Treasury ."
This was followed at the end of 2011 with a transfer of $ 77 billion in profits to the U.S. Treasury Department .
"Thick , unblended foundation on skin"
"Foundation is a skin coloured cosmetic applied to the face to create an even , uniform colour to the complexion , to cover flaws , and , sometimes , to change the natural skintone ."
Foundation applied to the body is generally referred to as `` body painting `` it is also rising in popularity with males .
"Abraham Lincoln ( February 12 , 1809 – April 15 , 1865 ) was the 16th President of the United States , serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 ."
"Lincoln led the United States through its greatest constitutional , military , and moral crises—the American Civil War —preserving the Union , abolishing slavery , strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy ."
"Reared in a poor family on the western frontier , Lincoln was self-educated , and became a country lawyer , a Whig Party leader , Illinois state legislator during the 1830s , and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives during the 1840s ."
"After a series of debates in 1858 that gave national visibility to his opposition to the expansion of slavery , Lincoln lost a Senate race to his arch-rival , Stephen A. Douglas ."
"Lincoln , a moderate from a swing state , secured the Republican Party presidential nomination in 1860 ."
"With almost no support in the South , Lincoln swept the North and was elected president in 1860 ."
His election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their secession from the Union and form the Confederacy .
"The departure of the Southerners gave Lincoln 's party firm control of Congress , but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found ."
"Lincoln explained in his second inaugural address : `` Both parties deprecated war , but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came . ''"
"When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12 , 1861 , Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort ."
His goal was now to reunite the nation .
"As the South was in a state of insurrection , Lincoln exercised his authority to suspend habeas corpus , arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists without trial ."
Lincoln averted British recognition of the Confederacy by skillfully handling the Trent affair in late 1861 .
"His efforts toward the abolition of slavery include issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery , and helping push through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which finally freed all slaves nationwide in December 1865 ."
"Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including commanding general Ulysses S. Grant ."
Lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate .
"Under Lincoln 's leadership , the Union set up a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , took control of the border slave states at the start of the war , gained control of communications with gunboats on the southern river systems , and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond , Virginia ."
"Each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865 ."
"An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to War Democrats and managed his own re-election in the 1864 presidential election ."
"As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party , Lincoln found his policies and personality were `` blasted from all sides '' : Radical Republicans demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats desired more compromise , Copperheads despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death ."
"Politically , Lincoln fought back with patronage , by pitting his opponents against each other , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory ."
His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history .
"It was an iconic statement of America 's dedication to the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy ."
"At the close of the war , Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness ."
"Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , however , Lincoln was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth ."
Lincoln 's death was the first assassination of a U.S. president and sent the nation into mourning .
Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the greatest U.S. presidents .
"Mark Cuban ( born July 31 , 1958 ) is an American businessman , investor , and philanthropist ."
"He is the owner of the National Basketball Association 's Dallas Mavericks , Landmark Theatres , and Magnolia Pictures , and the chairman of the HDTV cable network AXS TV ."
He is also a `` shark '' investor on the television series Shark Tank .
"In 2011 , Cuban wrote an e-book , How to Win at the Sport of Business , in which he chronicles his life experiences in business and sports ."
"The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is a single-seat , twin-engine fifth-generation supermaneuverable fighter aircraft that uses stealth technology ."
"It was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter , but has additional capabilities that include ground attack , electronic warfare , and signals intelligence roles ."
"Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is the prime contractor and is responsible for the majority of the airframe , weapon systems and final assembly of the F-22 ."
"Program partner Boeing Defense , Space & Security provides the wings , aft fuselage , avionics integration , and training systems ."
The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 during the years prior to formally entering USAF service in December 2005 as the F-22A .
"Despite a protracted and costly development period , the United States Air Force considers the F-22 a critical component of U.S. tactical air power , and claims that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter ."
"Lockheed Martin claims that the Raptor 's combination of stealth , speed , agility , precision and situational awareness , combined with air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities , makes it the best overall fighter in the world today ."
"Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston , former Chief of the Australian Defence Force , said in 2004 that the `` F-22 will be the most outstanding fighter plane ever built . ''"
"The high cost of the aircraft , a lack of clear air-to-air combat missions because of delays in the Russian and Chinese fifth-generation fighter programs , a U.S. ban on Raptor exports , and the ongoing development of the planned cheaper and more versatile F-35 resulted in calls to end F-22 production ."
"In April 2009 , the U.S. Department of Defense proposed to cease placing new orders , subject to Congressional approval , for a final procurement tally of 187 operational aircraft ."
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 lacked funding for further F-22 production .
The final F-22 rolled off the assembly line on 13 December 2011 during a ceremony at Dobbins Air Reserve Base .
Since 2010 the F-22 has been plagued by unresolved problems with its pilot oxygen systems which contributed to one crash and death of a pilot .
"In 2011 the fleet was grounded for four months before resuming flight operations , but reports of oxygen systems issues have continued ."
"In July 2012 , the Air Force announced that the hypoxia-like symptoms experienced were caused by a faulty valve in the pilots ' pressure vest ; the valve was replaced and changes to the filtration system were also made ."

"This animation uses Earth science data from a variety of sensors on NASA Earth observing satellites to measure physical oceanography parameters such as ocean currents , ocean winds , sea surface height and sea surface temperature ."
An ocean ( ; the World Ocean of classical antiquity ) is a body of saline water that composes a large part of a planet 's hydrosphere .
"In the context of Earth , it refers to one or all of the major divisions of the planet 's World Ocean – they are , in descending order of area , the Pacific , Atlantic , Indian , Southern ( Antarctic ) , and Arctic Oceans ."
"The word `` sea `` is often used interchangeably with `` ocean '' , but strictly speaking a sea is a body of saline water ( possibly a division of the World Ocean ) partly or fully enclosed by land ."
Earth is the only planet known to have an ocean ( or any large amounts of open liquid water ) .
"Approximately 72 % of the planet 's surface ( ~3.6x108 km2 ) is covered by saline water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas , with the ocean covering approximately 71 % of the Earth 's surface ."
"In terms of the hydrosphere of the Earth , the ocean contains 97 % of the Earth 's water ."
"Oceanographers have stated that out of 97 % , only 5 % of the ocean as a whole on Earth has been explored ."
"Because it is the principal component of Earth 's hydrosphere , the world ocean is integral to all known life , forms part of the carbon cycle , and influences climate and weather patterns ."
The total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres ( 310 million cu mi ) with an average depth of .
"It is the habitat of 230,000 known species , although much of the ocean 's depths remain unexplored and it is estimated that over two million marine species exist ."
"The origin of Earth 's oceans is still unknown , but oceans are believed to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life ."
Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of a wide range of elements and compounds .
"The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan , although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System ."
"Early in their geologic histories , Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans ."
"The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water , though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic , and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus ."
"Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point , so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice ."
"Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites ; notably , the ocean of Europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of Earth ."
The Solar System 's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions .
"Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons , including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone ."
Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid .
"Toledo Zoo is a zoo located in Toledo , Ohio ."
The zoo began in 1900 as Toledo Zoological Gardens and operated by the City of Toledo 's Parks Board .
"In 1982 ownership was transferred from the city to Toledo Zoological Society , a private non-profit organization , and professionalized the zoo 's management ."
"Many of the zoo 's original buildings were built by the Works Progress Administration , and are still in use today ."
"Toledo Zoo is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( WAZA ) and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( AZA ) , and participates in over 30 Species Survival Plans ."
It is also a member of the Butterfly Conservation Initiative ( BFCI ) .
"The zoo has also been home to many firsts in the world of zoos ; such as the first hippoquarium ( and subsequently the first video of a hippo birth ) , as well as being the first place in the world to display the Kihansi Spray Toad ."
"Film budgeting refers to the process by which a line producer , unit production manager or filmmaker prepares a budget for a film production ."
"This document , which could be over 150 pages long , is used to secure financing for the film and lead to pre-production and production of the film ."
Multiple drafts of the budget may be required to whittle down costs .
"A budget is typically divided into four sections : above the line ( creative talent ) , below the line ( direct production costs ) , post-production ( editing , visual effects , etc . ) , and other ( insurance , completion bond , etc . ) ."
"Film financing can be acquired from a private investor , sponsor , product placement , a film studio or entertainment company , or out of pocket funds ."
The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the United States .
"It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts and over state court cases involving issues of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a small range of cases ."
"The Court , which meets in the United States Supreme Court Building in Washington , D.C. , consists of a chief justice and eight associate justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate ."
"Once appointed , justices have life tenure unless they resign , retire , or are removed after impeachment ."
Diagnosis-related group ( DRG ) is a system to classify hospital cases into one of originally 467 groups .
The 467th group was `` Ungroupable '' .
"This system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by Robert B Fetter , PhD , of the Yale School of Management , and John D Thompson , MPH , of the Yale School of Public Health ."
"The system is also referred to as `` the DRGs '' , and its intent was to identify the `` products '' that a hospital provides ."
One example of a `` product '' is an appendectomy .
"The system was developed in anticipation of convincing Congress to use it for reimbursement , to replace `` cost based '' reimbursement that had been used up to that point ."
"DRGs are assigned by a `` grouper '' program based on ICD ( International Classification of Diseases ) diagnoses , procedures , age , sex , discharge status , and the presence of complications or comorbidities ."
"DRGs have been used in the US since 1982 to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital for each `` product '' , since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of hospital resources ."
DRGs may be further grouped into Major Diagnostic Categories ( MDCs ) .
DRGs are also standard practice for establishing reimbursements for other Medicare related reimbursements such as to home healthcare providers .
The Pacific Ocean
The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth 's oceanic divisions .
"It extends from the Arctic in the north to the Southern Ocean ( or , depending on definition , to Antarctica ) in the south , bounded by Asia and Australia in the west , and the Americas in the east ."
"At 165.25 million square kilometres ( 63.8 million square miles ) in area , this largest division of the World Ocean – and , in turn , the hydrosphere – covers about 46 % of the Earth 's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area , making it larger than all of the Earth 's land area combined ."
"The equator subdivides it into the North Pacific Ocean and South Pacific Ocean , with two exceptions : the Galápagos and Gilbert Islands , while straddling the equator , are deemed wholly within the South Pacific ."
"The Mariana Trench in the western North Pacific is the deepest point in the world , reaching a depth of ."
The eastern Pacific Ocean was first sighted by Europeans in the early 16th century when Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513 and discovered the great `` southern sea '' which he named Mar del Sur .
"The ocean 's current name was bestowed by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan during the Spanish expedition of world circumnavigation in 1521 , who encountered favourable winds as he reached the ocean and called it Mar Pacifico in Portuguese , meaning `` peaceful sea '' ."
The plus-minus sign ( ) is a mathematical symbol commonly used either
"to indicate the precision of an approximation , or"
to indicate a value that can be of either sign .
The sign is normally pronounced `` plus or minus '' .
"In experimental sciences , the sign commonly indicates the confidence interval or error in a measurement , often the standard deviation or standard error ."
The sign may also represent an inclusive range of values that a reading might have .
"In mathematics , it may indicate two possible values : one positive , and one negative ."
"It is commonly used in indicating a range of values , such as in mathematical statements ."
"Judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) is a motion made by a party , during trial , claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case ."
"JMOL is also known as a directed verdict , which it has replaced in American Federal courts ."
"JMOL is similar to judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment , all of which test the factual sufficiency of a claim ."
Judgment on the pleadings is a motion made after pleading and before discovery ; summary judgment happens after discovery and before trial ; JMOL occurs during trial .
"In United States federal courts , JMOL is a creation of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 50 ."
JMOL is decided by the standard of whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of the party opposing the JMOL motion .
"If there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party , judgment is entered by the court and the case is over ."
"If there is sufficient evidence to make a reasonable conclusion in favor of the opposing party , but there is equally strong evidence to support an opposite conclusion , the party with the burden of persuasion fails ."
Timing is very important in making a motion for JMOL ; the motion can only be made once the opposing party has presented its case .
"In civil cases , the plaintiff presents her case , then the defendant presents his/her case , then the plaintiff may present a rebuttal ."
"So , once the plaintiff has presented his/her case , the defendant may move for JMOL , but the plaintiff may not ."
"Once the defendant has finished presenting his/her case , the plaintiff may move for JMOL , and so may the defendant ."
"JMOL motions may also be made after the verdict is returned , where they are called `` renewed '' motions for judgment as a matter of law ( RJMOL ) , but the motion is still commonly known by its former name , judgment notwithstanding verdict , or j.n.o.v . ( from the English judgment and the Latin non obstante veredicto ) ."
"However , in order to move for j.n.o.v. , the movant must have moved for a JMOL before the verdict as well ."
This procedural quirk is necessary because it is considered a violation of the 7th amendment for a judge to overturn a jury verdict .
"Instead , the judge is said in a j.n.o.v . to be reexamining not the verdict , but his previous rejection of JMOL ."
Christianity ( from the and the Latin suffix -itas ) is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ as presented in canonical gospels and other New Testament writings as well as the Old Testament .
"Most adherents of the Christian faith , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Son of God , fully divine and fully human and the savior of humanity prophesied in the Old Testament ."
"Consequentially , Christians commonly refer to Jesus as Christ or Messiah ."
The foundation of Christian theology is expressed in the early ecumenical creeds which contain claims predominantly accepted by followers of the Christian faith .
"These professions state that Jesus suffered , died , was buried , and was subsequently resurrected from the dead in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust him for the remission of their sins ."
They further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven where he rules and reigns with God the Father .
"Most denominations teach that Jesus will return to judge all humans , living and dead , and grant eternal life to his followers ."
"He is considered the model of a virtuous life , and his ministry , crucifixion , and resurrection are often referred to as the gospel , meaning `` Good News `` ( from the ) ."
Christianity began as a Jewish sect in the mid-1st century .
"Originating in the Levant region of the Middle East , it quickly spread to Syria , Mesopotamia , Asia Minor and Egypt ."
"It grew in size and influence over a few centuries , and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire , replacing other forms of religion practiced under Roman rule ."
"During the Middle Ages , most of the remainder of Europe was Christianized , with Christians also being a sometimes large religious minority in the Middle East , North Africa , Ethiopia and parts of India ."
"Following the Age of Discovery , Christianity spread to the Americas , Australasia , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization ."
Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization .
"Worldwide , the three largest groups of Christianity are the Roman Catholic Church , the Eastern Orthodox Church , and the various denominations of Protestantism ."
"The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox patriarchates split from one another in the schism of the 11th century , and Protestantism came into existence during the Reformation of the 16th century , splitting from the Roman Catholic Church ."
"As of the early 21st century , Christianity is the world 's largest religion , with approximately 2.2 billion adherents ."
"A Formula One car is a single-seat , open cockpit , open-wheel racing car with substantial front and rear wings , and an engine positioned behind the driver , intended to be used in competition at Formula One racing events ."
The regulations governing the cars are unique to the championship .
"The Formula One regulations specify that cars must be constructed by the racing teams themselves , though the design and manufacture can be outsourced ."
"Dry drowning occurs when a person 's lungs become unable to extract oxygen from the air , due primarily to:"
Muscular paralysis
Puncture wound to the torso ( affecting ability of diaphragm to create respiratory movement )
Changes to the oxygen-absorbing tissues
Persistence of laryngospasm when immersed in fluid
Prolonged exposure to a gas that displaces oxygen from the lungs ( e.g . methane )
Overdose of solute free water which leads to hyponatremia and swelling in the brain
Holding one 's breath ( Apnea )
The person may effectively drown without any sort of liquid .
"In cases of dry drowning in which the victim was immersed , very little fluid is aspirated into the lungs ."
The laryngospasm reflex essentially causes asphyxiation and neurogenic pulmonary edema ( œdema ) .
"Dry drowning can occur clinically , or due to illness or accident ."
It is also one of the effects of waterboarding .
"The City of Aurora ( , ) is a Home Rule Municipality in the U.S. state of Colorado , spanning Arapahoe and Adams counties , with the extreme southeastern portion of the city extending into Douglas County ."
"Aurora is one of the principal cities of the Denver-Aurora-Broomfield , CO Metropolitan Statistical Area ( Metro Denver ) ."
"The city 's population was 325,078 in the 2010 Census , which makes it the third most populous city in the state of Colorado and the 56th most populous city in the United States ."
"Denver and Aurora are the principal cities of the Denver Metropolitan Area , which in 2007 had an estimated population of 2,464,866 ( the 22nd most populous MSA in the U.S. ) ."
"However , Denver and Aurora combined make up less than half of the Metro Denver Area 's population and Aurora has approximately half the population of Denver ."
"The estimated population of Metropolitan Denver was 2,998,878 in 2007 ( 15th most populous CSA ) ."
"Holly Ridge is a town in Onslow County , North Carolina , United States ."
The 2008 estimated population was 908 .
"It is part of the Jacksonville , North Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area ."
"A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight ."
Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth 's axis relative to the plane of revolution .
"In temperate and polar regions , the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth 's surface , variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate , and plants to be dormant ."
"During May , June and July , the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun ."
"The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November , December and January ."
It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux .
"However , due to seasonal lag , June , July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December , January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere ."
"In temperate and subpolar regions , generally four calendar -based seasons ( with their adjectives ) are recognized : spring ( vernal ) , summer ( estival ) , autumn ( autumnal ) and winter ( hibernal ) ."
"However , ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring ( prevernal ) and late summer ( serotinal ) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four ."
"Hot regions have two or three seasons ; the rainy ( or wet , or monsoon ) season and the dry season , and in some tropical areas , a cool or mild season ."
"In some parts of the world , special `` seasons '' are loosely defined based on important events such as a hurricane season , tornado season or a wildfire season ."

"Color blindness or color vision deficiency is the inability or decreased ability to see color , or perceive color differences , under normal lighting conditions ."
Color blindness affects a significant percentage of the population .
There is no actual blindness but there is a deficiency of color vision .
The most usual cause is a fault in the development of one or more sets of retinal cones that perceive color in light and transmit that information to the optic nerve .
This type of color blindness is usually a sex-linked condition .
"The genes that produce photopigments are carried on the X chromosome ; if some of these genes are missing or damaged , color blindness will be expressed in males with a higher probability than in females because males only have one X chromosome ( in females , a functional gene on only one of the two X chromosomes is sufficient to yield the needed photopigments ) ."
"Color blindness can also be produced by physical or chemical damage to the eye , the optic nerve , or parts of the brain ."
"For example , people with achromatopsia suffer from a completely different disorder , but are nevertheless unable to see colors ."
"The English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific paper on this subject in 1798 , `` Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours '' , after the realization of his own color blindness ."
"Because of Dalton 's work , the general condition has been called daltonism , although in English this term is now used more narrowly for deuteranopia alone ."
"Color blindness is usually classified as a mild disability , however there are occasional circumstances where it can give an advantage ."
Some studies conclude that color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflages .
Such findings may give an evolutionary reason for the high prevalence of red–green color blindness .
And there is also a study suggesting that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal color vision are not able to distinguish .
"John Ernst Steinbeck , Jr. ( February 27 , 1902 – December 20 , 1968 ) was an American writer ."
He is widely known for the Pulitzer Prize -winning novel The Grapes of Wrath ( 1939 ) and East of Eden ( 1952 ) and the novella Of Mice and Men ( 1937 ) .
"As the author of twenty-seven books , including sixteen novels , six non-fiction books , and five collections of short stories , Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962 ."
"Norman Eugene Walker , known as Clint Walker ( born May 30 , 1927 ) , is a retired American actor ."

"The history of slavery covers slave systems in historical perspective in which one human being is legally the property of another , can be bought or sold , is not allowed to escape and must work for the owner without any choice involved ."
"As Drescher ( 2009 ) argues , `` The most crucial and frequently utilized aspect of the condition is a communally recognized right by some individuals to possess , buy , sell , discipline , transport , liberate , or otherwise dispose of the bodies and behavior of other individuals . ''"
An integral element is that children of a slave mother automatically become slaves .
"It does not include historical forced labor by prisoners , labor camps , or other forms of unfree labor in which laborers are not considered property ."
"Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records , such as the Code of Hammurabi ( c. 1760 BC ) , which refers to it as an established institution ."
Slavery is rare among hunter-gatherer populations as slavery depends on a system of social stratification .
Slavery typically also requires a shortage of labor and a surplus of land to be viable .
David P. Forsythe wrote : `` The fact remained that at the beginning of the nineteenth century an estimated three-quarters of all people alive were trapped in bondage against their will either in some form of slavery or serfdom . ''
Slavery is no longer legal anywhere in the world .
Mauritania abolished it in law in 1981 and was the last country to do so – see Abolition of slavery timeline .
"However , the number of slaves today is higher than at any point in history , remaining as high as 12 million to 27 million ."
"Eldrick Tont `` Tiger '' Woods ( born December 30 , 1975 ) is an American professional golfer whose achievements to date rank him among the most successful golfers of all time ."
"Currently the World No . 1 , he has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years according to Forbes ."
"Woods turned professional in 1996 , and by April 1997 he had already won his first major , the 1997 Masters in a record-breaking performance ."
He first reached the number one position in the world rankings in June 1997 .
"Through the 2000s , Woods was the dominant force in golf , spending 264 weeks from August 1999 to September 2004 and 281 weeks from June 2005 to October 2010 as world number one ."
"From December 2009 to early April 2010 , Woods took leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity ."
"His multiple infidelities were revealed by several different women , through many worldwide media sources ."
"This was followed by a loss of form , and his ranking gradually fell to a low of No . 58 in November 2011 ."
He snapped a career-long winless streak of 107 weeks when he captured the Chevron World Challenge in December 2011 .
"As of March 25 , 2013 , he is ranked No . 1 , after winning the 2013 Arnold Palmer Invitational ."
Woods has broken numerous golf records .
He has been world number one for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any other golfer .
"He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record ten times , the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times , and has the record of leading the money list in nine different seasons ."
"He has won 14 professional major golf championships , the second highest of any player ( Jack Nicklaus leads with 18 ) , and 77 PGA Tour events , 2nd all time behind Sam Snead ."
He has more career major wins and career PGA Tour wins than any other active golfer .
"He is the youngest player to achieve the career Grand Slam , and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour ."
"Additionally , Woods is only the second golfer , after Jack Nicklaus , to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times ."
"Woods has won 17 World Golf Championships , and won at least one of those events in each of the first 11 years after they began in 1999 ."
`` Boardwalk Empire '' is the pilot episode of the HBO crime drama Boardwalk Empire .
"Written by series creator Terence Winter and directed by Martin Scorsese with a budget of $ 18 million , the episode introduces the character of Nucky Thompson , played by Steve Buscemi , as the corrupt treasurer of Atlantic City who is involved in gambling and bootlegging in 1920 ."
"The show used a large ensemble cast and a specially constructed boardwalk set to re-create the Prohibition and Jazz Era , and was based on Boardwalk Empire : The Birth , High Times and Corruption of Atlantic City by Nelson Johnson ."
Filming for the pilot took place at various locations in and around New York City in June 2009 .
"The episode first aired in the United States on September 19 , 2010 ."
"The episode opens with bootleggers being ambushed , and then moves to a Temperance rally two days earlier during which Nucky Thompson attracts the attention of a pregnant woman who later seeks assistance from Thompson for her husband , Schroeder ."
"In a night club the day after the rally , we are introduced to other characters , including Thompson 's brother , Eli , the town sheriff , and Jimmy Darmody , a political assistant ."
"Thompson makes a deal to supply alcohol to four gangsters , including Rothstein who agrees to use his own men to transport the alcohol ."
"Meanwhile Schroeder drunkenly tangles with Thompson , and then beats his wife who miscarries ."
"The next day , Darmody plots with Al Capone to rob Rothstein 's incoming whiskey shipment ."
"The episode returns to the ambush and we see Capone and Darmody shoot all the bootleggers and run off with the whiskey , with Darmody later giving Thompson a share of the heist ."
"David Hinkley of the New York Daily News awarded the episode five stars , saying `` Watching HBO 's new 'Boardwalk Empire ' is like sitting in your favorite tavern and hearing someone say , 'Drinks are on the house . '"
"Friends , it does n't get much better . ''"
"Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times called it `` ... an event not to be missed , '' and praised Buscemi in particular , calling his performance `` fascinating . ''"
The episode gained a 2.0/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49 and garnered 4.81 million viewers .
This was the highest rated premiere for a HBO series since the pilot of Deadwood in March 2004 .
"Following this successful debut , HBO immediately renewed the series for a second season ."
Urban runoff entering a storm drain
Stormwater is water that originates during precipitation events .
It may also be used to apply to water that originates with snowmelt that enters the stormwater system .
"Stormwater that does not soak into the ground becomes surface runoff , which either flows directly into surface waterways or is channeled into storm sewers , which eventually discharge to surface waters ."
"Stormwater is of concern for two main issues : one related to the volume and timing of runoff water ( flood control and water supplies ) and the other related to potential contaminants that the water is carrying , i.e . water pollution ."
Stormwater is also a resource and ever growing in importance as the world 's human population demand exceeds the availability of readily available water .
Techniques of stormwater harvesting with point source water management and purification can potentially make urban environments self-sustaining in terms of water .

A medical/clinical thermometer showing the temperature of 38.7 °C
Attempts of standardized temperature measurement have been reported as early as 170 AD by Claudius Galenus .
The modern scientific field has its origins in the works by Florentine scientists in the 17th century .
Early devices to measure temperature were called thermoscopes .
"The first sealed thermometer was constructed in 1641 by the Grand Duke of Toscani , Ferdinand II ."
"The development of today 's thermometers and temperature scales began in the early 18th century , when Gabriel Fahrenheit adapted a thermometer using mercury and a scale both developed by Ole Christensen Rømer ."
"Fahrenheit 's scale is still in use , alongside the Celsius scale and the Kelvin scale ."

"For the diplomat , see Douglas MacArthur II ."
"For other uses , see General MacArthur ( disambiguation ) ."
General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ( 26 January 18805 April 1964 ) was an American general and field marshal of the Philippine Army who was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II .
"He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign , which made him and his father Arthur MacArthur , Jr. , the first father and son to be awarded the medal ."
"He was one of only five men ever to rise to the rank of General of the Army in the U.S. Army , and the only man ever to become a field marshal in the Philippine Army ."
"Raised in a military family in the American Old West , MacArthur was valedictorian at the West Texas Military Academy , and First Captain at the United States Military Academy at West Point , where he graduated top of the class of 1903 ."
"During the 1914 United States occupation of Veracruz , he conducted a reconnaissance mission , for which he was nominated for the Medal of Honor ."
"In 1917 , he was promoted from major to colonel and became chief of staff of the 42nd ( Rainbow ) Division ."
"In the fighting on the Western Front during World War I , he rose to the rank of brigadier general , was again nominated for a Medal of Honor , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross twice and the Silver Star seven times ."
"From 1919 to 1922 , MacArthur served as Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , where he attempted a series of reforms ."
"His next assignment was in the Philippines , where in 1924 he was instrumental in quelling the Philippine Scout Mutiny ."
"In 1925 , he became the Army 's youngest major general ."
He served on the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell and was president of the American Olympic Committee during the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam .

"As such , he was involved in the expulsion of the Bonus Army protesters from Washington , D.C. in 1932 , and the establishment and organization of the Civilian Conservation Corps ."
He retired from the U.S. Army in 1937 to become Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines .
MacArthur was recalled to active duty in 1941 as commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East .
"A series of disasters followed , starting with the destruction of his air forces on 8 December 1941 , and the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese ."
"MacArthur 's forces were soon compelled to withdraw to Bataan , where they held out until May 1942 ."
"In March 1942 , MacArthur , his family and his staff left nearby Corregidor Island in PT boats and escaped to Australia , where MacArthur became Supreme Commander , Southwest Pacific Area ."
"For his defense of the Philippines , MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor ."
"After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific , he fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines ."
"He officially accepted Japan 's surrender on 2 September 1945 , and oversaw the occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1951 ."

He later became Chairman of the Board of Remington Rand .
"The Eiffel Tower ( , ) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris , named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel , whose company designed and built the tower ."
"Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World 's Fair , it has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world ."
The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world ; 7.1 million people ascended it in 2011 .
"The third level observatory 's upper platform is at the highest accessible to public in the European Union and the highest in Europe as long as the platform of the Ostankino Tower , at , remains closed as a result of the fire of August 2000 ."
The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010 .
"The tower stands tall , about the same height as an 81-storey building ."
"During its construction , the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world , a title it held for 41 years , until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930 ."
"Because of the addition , in 1957 , of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower , it is now taller than the Chrysler Building ."
"Not including broadcast antennas , it is the second-tallest structure in France , after the Millau Viaduct ."
The tower has three levels for visitors .
"Tickets can be purchased to ascend , by stairs or lift ( elevator ) , to the first and second levels ."
"The walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps , as is the walk from the first to the second level ."
The third and highest level is accessible only by lift—stairs do exist but are usually closed to the public .
The first and second levels have restaurants .
"The tower has become the most prominent symbol of both Paris and France , often in the establishing shot of films set in the city ."
Pilgrims at the Masjid al-Haram on Hajj in 2008
"The Hajj ( ' `` '' ) or haj is one of the largest annually occurring pilgrimages in the world , and one of the five pillars of Islam , a religious duty that must be carried out by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to do so at least once in his or her lifetime ."
The state of being physically and financially capable of performing the Hajj is called istita'ah and a Muslim who fulfils this condition is called a mustati .
"The Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people , and their submission to God ( Allah in the Arabic language ) ."
"The pilgrimage occurs from the 8th to 12th Dhu al-Hijjah , the 12th and last month of the Islamic calendar ."
"Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar , eleven days shorter than the Gregorian calendar used in the Western world , the Gregorian date of the Hajj changes from year to year ."
Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which Muslims live while on the pilgrimage .
"The Hajj is associated with the life of Prophet Muhammad from the 7th century , but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham ( Ibrahim ) ."
"Pilgrims join processions of hundreds of thousands of people , who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj , and perform a series of rituals : Each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Ka'aba , the cube-shaped building which acts as the Muslim direction of prayer , runs back and forth between the hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwah , drinks from the Zamzam Well , goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil , and throws stones in a ritual ."
"The pilgrims then shave their heads , perform a ritual of animal sacrifice , and celebrate the four day global festival of Eid al-Adha ."
"ShopNBC is an American broadcast and cable home shopping network , owned and operated by ValueVision Media , which is in turn 30 % owned by GE Equity and NBC Universal ."

Its main competitors are HSN ( Home Shopping Network ) and QVC .
"Stonehenge , an example of Neolithic architecture post and lintel construction ."
"Post and lintel , `` prop and lintel '' or `` trabeated '' is a simple construction method using a lintel , header , or architrave as the horizontal member over a building void supported at its ends by two vertical columns , , or ."
This architectural system and building method has been commonly used for centuries to support the weight of the structure located above the openings created by windows and doors in a bearing wall .
"Post and lintel is different than a beam joined between two posts , it must pass over the tops of the supports ."
Post-and-beam is a general term for any kind of timber framing .
"The Scarlet Letter is an 1850 romantic work of fiction in a historical setting , written by Nathaniel Hawthorne ."
It is considered to be his magnum opus .
"Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston , Massachusetts during the years 1642 to 1649 , it tells the story of Hester Prynne , who conceives a daughter through an adulterous affair and struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity ."
"Throughout the book , Hawthorne explores themes of legalism , sin , and guilt ."
"Judaica ( clockwise from top ) : Shabbat candlesticks , handwashing cup , Chumash and Tanakh , Torah pointer , shofar and etrog box"
"Judaism ( from the Latin Iudaismus , derived from the Greek Ioudaïsmos , and ultimately from the Hebrew , Yehudah , `` Judah `` ; in Hebrew : , Yahadut , the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos ) is the religion , philosophy and way of life of the Jewish people ."
"Judaism is a monotheistic religion , with its main inspiration being based on or found in the Hebrew Bible ( also known as the Tanakh ) which has been explored in later texts , such as the Talmud ."
Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship God established with the Children of Israel .
"Judaism is not a homogenous religion , and embraces a number of streams and views ."
"Today , Rabbinic Judaism is the most numerous stream , and holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah ."
"Historically , this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period ; the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period ; and among segments of the modern reform movements ."
Liberal movements in modern times such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic .
"Today , the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism ( Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism ) , Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism ."
A major source of difference between these groups is their approach to Jewish law .
"Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin , eternal and unalterable , and that they should be strictly followed ."
"Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal , with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more `` traditional '' interpretation of Judaism 's requirements than Reform Judaism ."
A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews .
"Historically , special courts enforced Jewish law ; today , these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary ."
"Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization , but in the sacred texts and rabbis and scholars who interpret them ."
"Judaism claims a historical continuity spanning more than 3,000 years ."
Judaism has its roots as a structured religion in the Middle East during the Bronze Age .
"Of the major world religions , Judaism is considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions ."
"The Hebrews / Israelites were already referred to as `` Jews '' in later books of the Tanakh such as the Book of Esther , with the term Jews replacing the title `` Children of Israel '' ."
"Judaism 's texts , traditions and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions , including Christianity , Islam and the Baha'i Faith ."
Many aspects of Judaism have also directly or indirectly influenced secular Western ethics and civil law .
Jews are an ethnoreligious group and include those born Jewish and converts to Judaism .
"In 2010 , the world Jewish population was estimated at 13.4 million , or roughly 0.2 % of the total world population ."
"About 42 % of all Jews reside in Israel and about 42 % reside in the United States and Canada , with most of the remainder living in Europe ."
The United States Marshals Service ( USMS ) is a U.S. federal law enforcement agency within the United States Department of Justice ( see ) .
The office of U.S . Marshal is the oldest federal law enforcement office in the United States though second to the U.S. Customs Service as the oldest federal agency ( July 1789 ) ; it was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 .
It assumed its current name in 1969 .
"The Marshals Service is part of the executive branch of government , and is the enforcement arm of the United States federal courts ."
"The U.S . Marshals are responsible for the protection of officers of the court , court buildings and the effective operation of the judiciary ."
"The service also assists with court security and prisoner transport , serves arrest warrants , and seeks fugitives ."
"William H. Bonney ( born William Henry McCarty , Jr. c. November 23 , 1859 – c. July 14 , 1881 ) , better known as Billy the Kid but also known as Henry Antrim , was a 19th-century American gunman who participated in the Lincoln County War and became a frontier outlaw in the American Old West ."
"According to legend , he killed 21 men , but it is generally believed that he killed between four and nine ."
He killed his first man at 15 .
"McCarty ( or Bonney , the name he used at the height of his notoriety ) was 5'8 '' ( 173 cm ) tall with blue eyes , a smooth complexion , and prominent front teeth ."
"He was said to be friendly and personable at times , and it 's been said that he was as lithe as a cat ."
Contemporaries described him as a `` neat '' dresser who favored an `` unadorned Mexican sombrero `` .
"These qualities , along with his cunning and celebrated skill with firearms , contributed to his paradoxical image as both a notorious outlaw and a folk hero ."
"Relatively unknown during most of his lifetime , Billy was catapulted into legend in 1881 when New Mexico 's governor , Lew Wallace , placed a price on his head ."
"In addition , the Las Vegas Gazette ( Las Vegas , New Mexico ) and the New York Sun carried stories about his exploits ."
Other newspapers followed suit .
"After his death , several biographies were written that portrayed the Kid in varying lights ."
"The thyroid hormones , triiodothyronine ( T3 ) and thyroxine ( T4 ) , are tyrosine -based hormones produced by the thyroid gland that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism ."
Iodine is necessary for the production of T3 and T4 .
"A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as goitre ."
"The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T4 ) , which has a longer half-life than T3 ."
The ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is roughly 20 to 1 .
T4 is converted to the active T3 ( three to four times more potent than T4 ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5'-iodinase ) .
These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T1a ) and thyronamine ( T0a ) .
"All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes , thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production ."
"The Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) , informally known as the Klan , is the name of three distinct past and present far-right organizations in the United States , which have advocated extremist reactionary currents such as white supremacy , white nationalism , and anti-immigration , historically expressed through terrorism ."
"Since the mid-20th century , the KKK has also been anti-communist ."
The current manifestation is splintered into several chapters with no connections between each other ; it is classified as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center .
"It is estimated to have between 5,000 and 8,000 members as of 2012 ."
"The first Klan flourished in the Southern United States in the late 1860s , then died out by the early 1870s ."
"Members adopted white costumes : robes , masks , and conical hats , designed to be outlandish and terrifying , and to hide their identities ."
"The second KKK flourished nationwide in the early and mid-1920s , and adopted the same costumes and code words as the first Klan , while introducing cross burnings ."
The third KKK emerged after World War II and was associated with opposing the Civil Rights Movement and progress among minorities .
"The second and third incarnations of the Ku Klux Klan made frequent reference to the USA 's `` Anglo-Saxon `` blood , harking back to 19th-century nativism and claiming descent from the original 18th-century British colonial revolutionaries ."
"Joe Bonamassa ( born May 8 , 1977 ) is an American blues rock guitarist and singer ."
"He began his career playing guitar in the band Bloodline , which also featured the offspring of Miles Davis , Robby Krieger of The Doors , and Berry Oakley of The Allman Brothers Band ."
"He released his first solo album A New Day Yesterday in 2000 , and has since released ten more solo studio albums , five live albums and four live DVDs , along with three albums with the band Black Country Communion , one with funk super-group Rock Candy Funk Party and one album in collaboration with vocalist Beth Hart ."
"He tours the world regularly , and has developed a large following in the U.S. and U.K. specifically ."
"His most recent album , Driving Towards The Daylight , reached # 2 on the U.K. Top 40 Albums Chart , and he completed an arena tour there in 2012 ."
"In 2009 he was the recipient of the Classic Rock Magazine `` Breakthrough Artist of the Year '' award , and The Guardian said of him : `` the 35-year-old from upstate New York has consolidated a reputation as the pre-eminent blues-rock guitarist of his generation '' ."
"Bonamassa has collaborated with numerous artists , including B.B . King , Eric Clapton , Beth Hart , Paul Rodgers , Leslie West , Jon Lord , Vince Gill , Sandi Thom and Glenn Hughes ."
"He also played with Hughes in Black Country Communion , along with Jason Bonham and Derek Sherinian ."
"Joe Bonamassa 's music contains a mix of several different genres : although it is primarily blues rock , since relocating to Santorini , Greece in 2009 to record the album Black Rock ( named after the studios in which it was created ) , his music has gained eastern influences , with the addition of instruments such as the bouzouki and clarinet ( for instance , on `` Black Lung Heartache '' from Dust Bowl and `` Athens to Athens '' from Black Rock ) ."
He has also covered songs by John Hiatt and Leonard Cohen .
"Education in the United States is mainly provided by the public sector , with control and funding coming from three levels : local , state , and federal , in that order ."
"Child education is compulsory , and there are also a large number and wide variety of higher education institutions throughout the country that one can choose to attend , both publicly and privately administered ."
Public education is universally available .
"School curricula , funding , teaching , employment , and other policies are set through locally elected school boards with jurisdiction over school districts with many directives from state legislatures ."
"School districts are usually separate from other local jurisdictions , with independent officials and budgets ."
Educational standards and standardized testing decisions are usually made by state governments .
The ages for compulsory education vary by state .
It begins from ages five to eight and ends from ages fourteen to eighteen .
"Compulsory education requirements can generally be satisfied by educating children in public schools , state-certified private schools , or an approved home school program ."
"In most public and private schools , education is divided into three levels : elementary school , middle school ( sometimes called junior high school ) , and high school ( sometimes referred to as secondary education ) ."
"In almost all schools at these levels , children are divided by age groups into grades , ranging from kindergarten ( followed by first grade ) for the youngest children in elementary school , up to twelfth grade , the final year of high school ."
The exact age range of students in these grade levels varies slightly from area to area .
"Post-secondary education , better known as `` college `` in the United States , is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system , and is described in a separate section below ."
"Government supported , free public schools for all started being established after the revolution , and expanded in the 19th century , as the results of efforts of men like Horace Mann and Booker T. Washington ."
"By 1870 , all states had free elementary schools , albeit only in urban centers ."
"As the 20th century drew nearer , states started passing laws to make schooling compulsory , and by 1910 , 72 percent of children attended school ."
"Private schools continued to spread during this time , as well as colleges and—in the rural centers— land grant colleges ."
The year of 1910 also saw the first true high schools .
"During the rest of the 20th century , educational efforts centered on reducing the inequality of the schooling system ."
"The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education made the desegregation of elementary and high schools a national priority , while the Pell Grant program helped poor minorities gain access to college ."
Special education was made into federal law in 1975 .
"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 made standardized testing a requirement , and in 1983 , a commission was established to evaluate their results and propose a course of action ."
The resulting No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was controversial and its goals proved to be unrealistic .
"A commission established in 2006 evaluated higher education , but its recommendations have yet to be fully implemented ."
What Happens in Vegas is a 2008 American romantic comedy film from 20th Century Fox starring Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher .
"The title is based on the marketing catchphrase , `` What happens in Vegas , stays in Vegas . ''"
"James Byron Dean ( February 8 , 1931 – September 30 , 1955 ) was an American actor ."
"He is a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment , as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film , Rebel Without a Cause ( 1955 ) , in which he starred as troubled Los Angeles teenager Jim Stark ."
"The other two roles that defined his stardom were as loner Cal Trask in East of Eden ( 1955 ) , and as the surly ranch hand , Jett Rink , in Giant ( 1956 ) ."
"Dean 's enduring fame and popularity rests on his performances in only these three films , all leading roles ."
His premature death in a car crash cemented his legendary status .
Dean was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and remains the only actor to have had two posthumous acting nominations .
"In 1999 , the American Film Institute ranked Dean the 18th best male movie star on their AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Stars list ."
Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax contemplating measuring instruments in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea
"A Love Meter and Strength tester machine at a Framingham , Massachusetts rest stop ."
A Measuring instrument is a device for measuring a physical quantity .
"In the physical sciences , quality assurance , and engineering , measurement is the activity of obtaining and comparing physical quantities of real-world objects and events ."
"Established standard objects and events are used as units , and the process of measurement gives a number relating the item under study and the referenced unit of measurement ."
"Measuring instruments , and formal test methods which define the instrument 's use , are the means by which these relations of numbers are obtained ."
All measuring instruments are subject to varying degrees of instrument error and measurement uncertainty .
"Scientists , engineers and other humans use a vast range of instruments to perform their measurements ."
These instruments may range from simple objects such as rulers and stopwatches to electron microscopes and particle accelerators .
Virtual instrumentation is widely used in the development of modern measuring instruments .
Double rainbow and supernumerary rainbows on the inside of the primary arc .
The shadow of the photographer 's head on the bottom marks the centre of the rainbow circle ( antisolar point ) .
"A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection of light in water droplets in the Earth 's atmosphere , resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky ."
It takes the form of a multicoloured arc .
Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun .
"In a `` primary rainbow '' , the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side ."
"This rainbow is caused by light being refracted while entering a droplet of water , then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it ."
"In a double rainbow , a second arc is seen outside the primary arc , and has the order of its colours reversed , red facing toward the other one , in both rainbows ."
This second rainbow is caused by light reflecting twice inside water droplets .
The French colonial Empire was the set of territories that were under French rule primarily from the 17th century to the late 1960s .
"In the 19th and 20th centuries , the colonial empire of France was the second-largest in the world behind the British Empire ."
"The French colonial empire extended over 12,347,000 km2 ( 4,767,000 sq . miles ) of land at its height in the 1920s and 1930s ."
"Including metropolitan France , the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached 13,018,575 km2 ( 4,980,000 sq . miles ) at the time , almost 1/10 of the Earth 's total land area ."
"Its influence made French a widely-spoken colonial European language , along with English , Spanish , Portuguese and Dutch ."
"In rivalry with England , France began to establish colonies in North America , the Caribbean , and India , following the Spanish and Portuguese successes during the Age of Discovery ."
"A series of wars with and Great Britain during the 18th century and early 19th century , which France lost , ended its colonial ambitions in these areas , and with it what some historians term the `` first '' French colonial empire ."
"In the 19th century , France established a new empire in Africa and Southeast Asia ."
In this period France 's conquest of an Empire in Africa was dressed up as a moral crusade .
"In 1884 Jules Ferry declared ; `` The higher races have a right over the lower races , they have a duty to civilize the inferior races . ''"
"Full citizenship rights - assimilation - were offered , although in reality `` assimilation was always receding [ and ] the colonial populations treated like subjects not citizens . ''"
"Following the First World War , and even more so after the Second World War , anti-colonial movements began to challenge European authority ."
"France unsuccessfully fought bitter wars in Vietnam and Algeria to keep its empire intact , but by the end of the 1960s many of France 's colonies had gained independence ."
"However , some remaining territories – especially islands and archipelagos – were integrated into France as overseas departments and territories ."
"These now total altogether 123,150 km2 ( 47,548 sq . miles ) , which amounts to only 1 % of the pre-1939 French colonial empire 's area , with 2,685,705 people living in them in 2011 ."
"All of them enjoy full political representation at the national level , as well as varying degrees of legislative self-governance ."

Diaphragm pump schematic .
"A diaphragm pump ( also known as a Membrane pump , Air Operated Double Diaphragm Pump ( AODD ) or Pneumatic Diaphragm Pump ) is a positive displacement pump that uses a combination of the reciprocating action of a rubber , thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves either side of the diaphragm ( check valve , butterfly valves , flap valves , or any other form of shut-off valves ) to pump a fluid ."
There are three main types of diaphragm pumps:
"Those in which the diaphragm is sealed with one side in the fluid to be pumped , and the other in air or hydraulic fluid ."
"The diaphragm is flexed , causing the volume of the pump chamber to increase and decrease ."
A pair of non-return check valves prevent reverse flow of the fluid .
"Those employing volumetric positive displacement where the prime mover of the diaphragm is electro-mechanical , working through a crank or geared motor drive , or purely mechanical , such as with a lever or handle ."
"This method flexes the diaphragm through simple mechanical action , and one side of the diaphragm is open to air ."
Those employing one or more unsealed diaphragms with the fluid to be pumped on both sides .
"The diaphragm ( s ) again are flexed , causing the volume to change ."
"When the volume of a chamber of either type of pump is increased ( the diaphragm moving up ) , the pressure decreases , and fluid is drawn into the chamber ."
"When the chamber pressure later increases from decreased volume ( the diaphragm moving down ) , the fluid previously drawn in is forced out ."
"Finally , the diaphragm moving up once again draws fluid into the chamber , completing the cycle ."
This action is similar to that of the cylinder in an internal combustion engine .

"Natchez is a city in and the county seat of Adams County , Mississippi , United States ."
"With a total population of 18,464 ( according to the 2000 census ) , it is the largest community and the only incorporated municipality within Adams County ."
"Located on the Mississippi River , some 90 miles southwest of Jackson , the capital of Mississippi , and 85 miles north of Baton Rouge , Louisiana , it is the eighteenth-largest city in the state ."
It is named for the Natchez tribe of Native Americans who lived in the vicinity through the arrival of Europeans in the eighteenth century .
"Established by French colonists in 1716 , Natchez is one of the oldest and most important European settlements in the lower Mississippi River Valley , and served as the capital of the Mississippi Territory and then the state of Mississippi ."
"It predates Jackson , which replaced Natchez as the capital in 1822 , by more than a century ."
"The strategic location of Natchez , on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River , ensured that it would become a pivotal center of trade , commerce , and the interchange of Native American , European , and African-American cultures in the region for the first two centuries of its existence ."
"In U. S. history , it is recognized particularly for its role in the development of the Old Southwest during the first half of the nineteenth century ."
"It was the southern terminus of the historic Natchez Trace , which provided many pilots of flatboats and keelboats a road back to their homes in the Ohio River Valley after unloading their cargo in the city ."
"Today Natchez serves in the same capacity for the modern Natchez Trace Parkway , which commemorates this route ."
"In the middle of the nineteenth century , the city became the home of a collection of extremely wealthy Southern planters , who owned vast tracts of land in the surrounding lowlands of Mississippi and Louisiana where they grew large crops of cotton and sugar cane using slave labor ."
"Natchez became the principal port from which these crops were exported , both upriver to Northern cities and downriver to New Orleans , where much of the cargo was exported to Europe ."
"The planters ' fortunes allowed them to build huge mansions in Natchez before 1860 , many of which survive to this day and form a major part of the city 's architecture and identity ."
Agriculture remained the primary economic sustenance for the region until well into the twentieth century .
"During the twentieth century the city 's economy experienced a downturn , first due to the replacement of steamboat traffic on the Mississippi River by railroads in the early 1900s , and later due to the exodus of many local industries that had provided a large number of jobs in the area ."
"Despite its status as a popular tourist destination for much of its preserved aspects of antebellum culture , Natchez has experienced a general decline in population since 1960 ."
"It remains the principal city of the Natchez , MS– LA Micropolitan Statistical Area ."

"Politically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland , which covers just under five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , a part of the United Kingdom , which covers the remainder and is located in the north-east of the island ."
The population of Ireland is approximately 6.4 million .
Just under 4.6 million live in the Republic of Ireland and just over 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland .
"The island 's geography comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland ."
"The island has lush vegetation , a product of its mild but changeable oceanic climate , which avoids extremes in temperature ."
Thick woodlands covered the island until the 17th century .
"Today , it is one of the most deforested areas in Europe ."
There are twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland .
A Norman invasion in the Middle Ages gave way to a Gaelic resurgence in the 13th century .
Over sixty years of intermittent warfare in the 1500s led to English dominance after 1603 .
"In the 1690s , a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters , and was extended during the 18th century ."
"In 1801 , Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom ."
"A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island , creating the Irish Free State , which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades , and Northern Ireland which remained a part of the United Kingdom ."
Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s .
This subsided following a political agreement in 1998 .
"In 1973 , both parts of Ireland joined the European Economic Community ."
"Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures , particularly in the fields of literature and , to a lesser degree , science and education ."
"Alongside mainstream Western culture , a strong indigenous culture exists , as expressed for example through Gaelic games , Irish music , and the Irish language ."
"The culture of the island has also many features shared with Great Britain , as expressed through sports such as association football , rugby , horse racing , and golf , as well as the English language ."

"A variety of energy drinks in a typical retail fridge display in Quebec City , Canada ."
"An energy drink is a type of beverage containing stimulant drugs , chiefly caffeine , which is marketed as providing mental or physical stimulation ."
There is a myriad of brands and varieties of energy drinks .
They generally contain large amounts of caffeine and other stimulants .
"Many also contain sugar or other sweeteners , herbal extracts and amino acids and may or may not be carbonated ."
"They are a subset of the larger group of energy products , which includes bars and gels ."
"Coffee , tea and other naturally caffeinated beverages are usually not considered energy drinks ."
"Soft drinks such as cola , may contain caffeine , but are also not energy drinks ."
"Some alcoholic beverages , such as Four Loko , contain caffeine and other stimulants and are marketed as energy drinks , although such drinks are banned in some American states ."
"The pharmaceutical industry develops , produces , and markets drugs or pharmaceuticals licensed for use as medications ."
Pharmaceutical companies are allowed to deal in generic and/or brand medications and medical devices .
"They are subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding the patenting , testing and ensuring safety and efficacy and marketing of drugs ."
The word pharmaceutical comes from the Greek word Pharmakeia .
The modern transliteration of Pharmakeia is Pharmacia .
Closeup of a maximum thermometer .
The break in the column of mercury is visible .
The mercury-in-glass or mercury thermometer was invented by German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1714 .
It consists of a bulb containing mercury attached to a glass tube of narrow diameter ; the volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume in the bulb .
The volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature ; the small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column a relatively long way up the tube .
"The space above the mercury may be filled with nitrogen or it may be at less than atmospheric pressure , a partial vacuum ."
"In order to calibrate the thermometer , the bulb is made to reach thermal equilibrium with a temperature standard such as an ice/water mixture , and then with another standard such as water/vapour , and the tube is divided into regular intervals between the fixed points ."
"In principle , thermometers made of different material ( e.g. , coloured alcohol ) might be expected to give different intermediate readings due to different expansion properties ; in practice the substances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics as a function of true thermodynamic temperature , and so give similar results ."
"Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational software corporation headquartered in Redmond , Washington that develops , manufactures , licenses , and supports a wide range of products and services related to computing ."
"The company was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4 , 1975 ."
Microsoft is the world 's largest software maker measured by revenues .
It is also one of the world 's most valuable companies .
Microsoft was established to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800 .
"It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s , followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems ."
"The company 's 1986 initial public offering , and subsequent rise in its share price , created an estimated three billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees ."
"Since the 1990s , it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions ."
"In May 2011 , Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies for $ 8.5 billion in its largest acquisition to date ."
"As of 2013 , Microsoft is market dominant in both the PC operating system and office suite markets ( the latter with Microsoft Office ) ."
"The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers , and is active in areas including internet search ( with Bing ) , the video game industry ( with the Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles ) , the digital services market ( through MSN ) , and mobile phones ( via the Windows Phone OS ) ."
"In June 2012 , Microsoft announced that it would be entering the PC vendor market for the first time , with the launch of the Microsoft Surface tablet computer ."
"In the 1990s , critics began to contend that Microsoft used monopolistic business practices and anti-competitive strategies including refusal to deal and tying , put unreasonable restrictions in the use of its software , and used misrepresentative marketing tactics ; both the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission found the company in violation of antitrust laws ."

"Walter Francis O'Malley ( October 9 , 1903 – August 9 , 1979 ) was an American sports executive who owned the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers team in Major League Baseball from to ."
He served as Brooklyn Dodgers chief legal counsel when Jackie Robinson broke the racial color barrier in .
"In , as owner of the Dodgers , he brought major league baseball to the West Coast , moving the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles and coordinating the move of the New York Giants to San Francisco at a time when there were no teams west of Kansas City , Missouri ."
"For this , he was long vilified by Brooklyn Dodgers fans ."
"However , neutral parties describe him as a visionary for the same business action , and many authorities cite him as one of the most influential sportsmen of the 20th century ."
"His detractors who say that he was not a visionary , but instead a man who was in the right place at the right time , still regard him as the most powerful and influential owner in baseball after moving the team ."
He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for his contributions to and influence on the game of baseball .
"O'Malley 's Irish father , Edwin Joseph O'Malley , was politically connected ."
"Walter , a University of Pennsylvania salutatorian , went on to obtain a Juris Doctorate , and he used the combination of his family connections , his personal contacts , and both his educational and vocational skills to rise to prominence ."
"First , he became an entrepreneur involved in public works contracting , and then he became an executive with the Dodgers ."
"He progressed from being a team lawyer to being both the Dodgers ' owner and president , and he eventually made the business decision to relocate the Dodgers franchise ."
"Although he moved the franchise , O'Malley is known as a businessman whose major philosophy was stability through loyalty to and from his employees ."
"O'Malley ceded the team presidency to his son , Peter , in but retained the titles of owner and chairman of the Dodgers until his death in 1979 ."
"During the 1975 season , the Dodgers ' inability to negotiate a contract with Andy Messersmith led to the Seitz decision , which limited the baseball reserve clause and paved the way for modern free agency ."
He bequeathed the team to his children Peter O'Malley and Therese O'Malley Seidler upon his death in 1979 .
The Platte River ( ) ( Pawnee : Kíckatusʾ ) is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about long .
"Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River , it flows for over ."
"The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River , which in turn is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico ."
"The Platte over most of its length is a muddy , broad , shallow , meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islands—a braided stream ."
"These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel , and it was never used as a major transportation route by European-American trappers or explorers ."
"The Platte is one of the most significant tributary systems in the watershed of the Missouri , draining a large portion of the central Great Plains in Nebraska and the eastern Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming ."
"The river valley played an important role in the westward expansion of the United States , providing the route for several major emigrant trails , including the Oregon , California , Mormon and Bozeman trails ."
"The first Europeans to see the Platte were French explorers and fur trappers about 1714 ; they first called it the Nebraskier ( Nebraska ) , a transliteration of the name given by the Otoe people , meaning `` flat water '' ."
The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States along with the Republican Party .

"Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed largely of the minerals calcite and aragonite , which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) ."
Many limestones are composed from skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral or foraminifera .
Limestone makes up about 10 % of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks .
"The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes , in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years ."
Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock .
"Limestone has numerous uses : as a building material , as aggregate for the base of roads , as white pigment or filler in products such as toothpaste or paints , and as a chemical feedstock ."
The first geologist to distinguish limestone from dolomite was Belsazar Hacquet in 1778 .
"Risk of infection is a nursing diagnosis which is defined as `` the state in which an individual is at risk to be invaded by an opportunistic or pathogenic agent ( virus , fungus , bacteria , protozoa , or other parasite ) from endogenous or exogenous sources '' and was approved by NANDA in 1986 ."
"Although anyone can become infected by a pathogen , patients with this diagnosis are at an elevated risk and extra infection controls should be considered ."
"New Berlin Observatory at Linden Street , where Neptune was discovered observationally ."
The planet Neptune was mathematically predicted before it was directly observed .
"With a prediction by Urbain Le Verrier , telescopic observations confirming the existence of a major planet were made on the night of September 23–24 , 1846 , at the Berlin Observatory , by astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle ( assisted by Heinrich Louis d'Arrest ) , working from Le Verrier 's calculations ."
It was a sensational moment of 19th century science and dramatic confirmation of Newtonian gravitational theory .
"In François Arago 's apt phrase , Le Verrier had discovered a planet `` with the point of his pen '' ."
"In retrospect , after it was discovered it turned out it had been observed many times before but not recognized , and there were others who made various calculations about its location , which did not lead to its observation ."
"By 1846 the planet Uranus had completed nearly one full orbit since its discovery by William Herschel in 1781 , and astronomers had detected a series of irregularities in its path which could not be entirely explained by Newton 's law of gravitation ."
"These irregularities could , however , be resolved if the gravity of a farther , unknown planet were disturbing its path around the Sun ."
In 1845 astronomers Urbain Le Verrier in Paris and John Couch Adams in Cambridge separately began calculations to determine the nature and position of such a planet .
"Unfortunately , Le Verrier 's triumph also led to a tense international dispute over priority , as , shortly after the discovery , George Airy , at the time British Astronomer Royal , announced that Adams had also predicted the discovery of the planet ."
"Nevertheless , the Royal Society awarded Le Verrier the Copley medal in 1846 for his achievement , without mention of Adams ."
The discovery of Neptune led to the discovery of its moon Triton by William Lassell just seventeen days later .
What Separates Me from You is the fourth studio album by American metalcore / pop punk band A Day to Remember .
"Originally set for release on October 26 , 2010 , the album was delayed until November 15 , 2010 , in the United Kingdom and the proceeding day in the United States ."
It featured a greater use of clean vocals and more of a pop punk style than the band 's previous releases .
"The album was recorded at Wade Studios in Ocala , Florida , from May to July 2010 ."
"It was mixed by David Bendeth , mastered by Ted Jensen , and produced by Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory and Andrew Wade , who also produced the band 's previous album , Homesick ( 2009 ) ."
"It was the first album featuring Kevin Skaff on guitar , following Tom Denney 's departue after Homesick ."
`` All I Want `` was released as What Separates Me from Yous first single .
It reached number 12 on US Alternative Songs and number 25 on Rock Songs .
"The album debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number 11 with 58,000 first week sales , becoming A Day to Remember 's personal best , as Homesick peaked at number 21 ."
"What Separates Me from You was met with critical success , with critics praising the album 's sound ."
The band toured worldwide in support of the release .
"Freddie Mercury ( born Farrokh Bulsara ; Gujarati : ફરોખ બલ્સારા‌ , Pharōkh Balsārā‌ ) ; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991 ) was a British musician , singer and songwriter , best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the rock band Queen ."
"As a performer , he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and powerful vocals over a four- octave range ."
"As a songwriter , Mercury composed many hits for Queen , including `` Bohemian Rhapsody `` , `` Killer Queen `` , `` Somebody to Love `` , `` Do n't Stop Me Now `` , `` Crazy Little Thing Called Love `` and `` We Are the Champions `` ."
"In addition to his work with Queen , he led a solo career , and also occasionally served as a producer and guest musician ( piano or vocals ) for other artists ."
"He died of bronchopneumonia brought on by AIDS on 24 November 1991 , only one day after publicly acknowledging he had the disease ."
Mercury was a Parsi born in Zanzibar and grew up there and in India until his mid-teens .
He has been referred to as `` Britain 's first Asian rock star '' .
"In 2002 , Mercury was placed at number 58 in the BBC 's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons , in 2006 , Time Asia named him one of the most influential Asian heroes of the past 60 years , and he continues to be voted one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music ."
"In 2005 , a poll organised by Blender and MTV2 saw Mercury voted the greatest male singer of all time ."
"In 2008 , Rolling Stone editors ranked him number 18 on their list of the 100 greatest singers of all time ."
"In 2009 , a Classic Rock poll saw him voted the greatest rock singer of all time ."
"Allmusic has characterised Mercury as `` one of rock 's greatest all-time entertainers '' , who possessed `` one of the greatest voices in all of music '' ."
"Lutheranism is a major branch of Western Christianity that identifies with the theology of Martin Luther , a German reformer ."
Luther 's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the Roman Catholic Church launched the Protestant Reformation .
"Beginning with the 95 Theses , Luther 's writings were disseminated internationally , spreading the ideas of the Reformation beyond the ability of governmental and churchly authorities to control it ."
"The split between the Lutherans and the Roman Catholics began with the 1521 Edict of Worms , which condemned Luther and officially outlawed citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending his ideas ."
"The punishment decreed for Lutheranism was seizure of all property , with half going to the Imperial government and half given to their accusers ."
The divide centered over the doctrine of Justification .
"Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification `` by grace alone through faith alone because of Christ alone , '' which went against the Roman view of `` faith formed by love '' , or `` faith and works '' ."
"Unlike the Reformed Churches , Lutherans retain a high respect for the authority of the Church Fathers , as well as many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church , with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist , or Lord 's Supper ."
"Lutheran theology significantly differs from Reformed theology in Christology , the purpose of God 's Law , the divine grace , the concept of perseverance of the saints , and predestination ."
"Like most denominations , Lutheranism is split between Liberal and Conservative/Confessional camps ."

Berliners watching a C-54 land at Tempelhof Airport ( 1948 )
The Berlin blockade ( 24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949 ) was one of the first major international crises of the Cold War .
"During the multinational occupation of post–World War II Germany , the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies ' railway , road , and canal access to the sectors of Berlin under Allied control ."
"Their aim was to force the western powers to allow the Soviet zone to start supplying Berlin with food and fuel , thereby giving the Soviets practical control over the entire city ."
"In response , the Western Allies organized the Berlin airlift to carry supplies to the people in West Berlin ."
"Aircrews from the United States Air Force , the British Royal Air Force , the Royal Australian Air Force , the Royal Canadian Air Force , the Royal New Zealand Air Force , and the South African Air Force flew over 200,000 flights in one year , providing up to 4700 tons of daily necessities such as fuel and food to the Berliners ."
"By the spring of 1949 , the effort was clearly succeeding and , by April , the airlift was delivering more cargo than had previously been transported into the city by rail ."
The success of the Berlin Airlift brought embarrassment to the Soviets who had refused to believe it could make a difference .
The blockade was lifted in May 1949 and resulted in the creation of two separate German states .
The Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) split up Berlin .
"In remembrance of the airlift , three airports in the former western zones of the city served as the primary gateways to Germany for another fifty years ."
"`` Proud Mary '' is a rock song written by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist John Fogerty , and recorded by his band Creedence Clearwater Revival ."
"The song was released as a single from the band 's second studio album , Bayou Country , both released by Fantasy Records in January 1969 ( although another reference related to album liner notes says just before Christmas , which would imply December 1968 ) ."
"The song became a hit in the United States , peaking at # 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1969 , the first of five non-consecutive singles to peak at # 2 for the group ."
"In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body ."
A significant fraction of the human body is water .
"Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that `` the total amount of water in a man of average weight ( 70 kilograms ) is approximately 40 litres , averaging 57 percent of his total body weight ."
"In a newborn infant , this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight , but it progressively decreases from birth to old age , most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life ."
"Also , obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body , sometimes to as low as 45 percent '' ."
"These figures are statistical averages , so are illustrative , and like all biostatistics , will vary with things like type of population , age and number of people sampled , and methodology ."
"So there is not , and can not be , a figure that is exactly the same for all people , for this or any other physiological measure ."
"For example , Jackson 's ( 1985 ) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60 % for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water , which approximates Guyton 's 57 % ."
"In diseased states where body water is affected , the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem ."
"Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone ( ADH ) , aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide ."
"Per Netter 's Atlas of Human Physiology , body water is broken down into the following compartments:"
Intracellular fluid ( 2/3 of body water ) .
"Per Guyton , in a body containing 40 litres of fluid , about 25 litres is intracellular , which amounts to 62.5 % ( 5/8 ) , close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb ."
Jackson 's texts states 70 % of body fluid is intracellular .
Extracellular fluid ( 1/3 of body water ) .
"Per Guyton 's illustration , for a 40 litre body , about 15 litres is extracellular , which amounts to 37.5 % Again , this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here ."
Plasma ( 1/5 of extracellular fluid ) .
"Per Guyton 's illustration , of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid , plasma volume averages 3 litres ."
"This amounts to 20 % , the same as per Netter 's Atlas ."
Interstitial fluid ( 4/5 of extracellular fluid )
"Transcellular fluid ( a.k.a . `` third space , '' normally ignored in calculations )"
"Contained inside organs , such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal , and ocular fluids ."
2000 Census Population Ancestry Map
Immigration to the United States is a complex demographic phenomenon that has been a major source of population growth and cultural change throughout much of the history of the United States .
"The economic , social , and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity , economic benefits , jobs for non-immigrants , settlement patterns , impact on upward social mobility , crime , and voting behavior ."
In 2006 the United States accepted more legal immigrants as permanent residents than all other countries in the world combined .
"After ethnic quotas on immigration were removed in 1965 the number of actual ( first-generation ) immigrants living in the United States eventually quadrupled , from 9.6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in 2007 ."
Over one million persons were naturalized as U.S. citizens in 2008 .
"The leading countries of origin of immigrants to the United States were Mexico , India , the Philippines , and China ."
Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the United States from 2000 to 2010 .
Family reunification accounts for approximately two-thirds of legal immigration to the US every year .
The number of foreign nationals who became legal permanent residents ( LPRs ) of the U.S. in 2009 as a result of family reunification ( 66 % ) exceeded those who became LPRs on the basis of employment skills ( 13 % ) and for humanitarian reasons ( 17 % ) .
"Migration is difficult , expensive , and dangerous for those who enter the US illegally across the Mexico–United States border ."
"Participants in debates on immigration in the early twenty-first century called for increasing enforcement of existing laws governing illegal immigration to the United States , building a barrier along some or all of the U.S.-Mexico border , or creating a new guest worker program ."
Through much of 2006 the country and Congress was immersed in a debate about these proposals .
"few of these proposals had become law , though a partial border fence had been approved and subsequently canceled ."
Vertically hung drywall with joint compound .
"Drywall ( also known as plasterboard , wallboard , gypsum board , or gyprock ) is a panel made of gypsum plaster pressed between two thick sheets of paper ."
It is used to make interior walls and ceilings .
Drywall construction became prevalent as a speedier alternative to traditional lath and plaster .
"In many places , the common term is a genericized trademark such as sheetrock or gyproc ."
"In New Zealand the category is known as `` plasterboard '' or `` gib board '' ( originally `` Gibraltar board '' ) , the latter being a proprietary brand name but now largely a genericised trademark ."

"Reconstruction by M. Gerasimov , Soviet archaeologist and anthropologist who developed the first technique of forensic sculpture ."
1965
"Forensic facial reconstruction ( or forensic facial approximation ) is the process of recreating the face of an individual ( whose identity is often not known ) from their skeletal remains through an amalgamation of artistry , forensic science , anthropology , osteology , and anatomy ."
It is easily the most subjective—as well as one of the most controversial—techniques in the field of forensic anthropology .
"Despite this controversy , facial reconstruction has proved successful frequently enough that research and methodological developments continue to be advanced ."
"In addition to remains involved in criminal investigations , facial reconstructions are created for remains believed to be of historical value and for remains of prehistoric hominids and humans ."
"Personifications of Germany , France , Russia , Austria-Hungary , and the United Kingdom attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war ."
They were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in in 1914 .
"The causes of World War I , which began in central Europe in late July 1914 and finished in 1918 , included many factors , such as the conflicts and hostility of the four decades leading up to the war ."
"Militarism , alliances , imperialism , and nationalism played major roles in the conflict as well ."
"The immediate origins of the war , however , lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the Crisis of 1914 , casus belli for which was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ( the Archduke of Austria Hungary ) and his wife Sophie by Gavrilo Princip , an irredentist Serb ."
"The crisis came after a long and difficult series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers ( Italy , France , Germany , the British Empire , the Austria-Hungarian Empire and Russia ) over European and colonial issues in the decade before 1914 that had left tensions high ."
In turn these diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1867 .
The more immediate cause for the war was tensions over territory in the Balkans .
Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the Great Powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties .
"Although the chain of events unleashed by the assassination triggered the war , the war 's origins go deeper , involving national politics , cultures , economics , and a complex web of alliances and counterbalances that had developed between the various European powers since 1870 ."
"Some of the most important long term or structural causes are : the growth of nationalism across Europe , unresolved territorial disputes , an intricate system of alliances , the perceived breakdown of the balance of power in Europe , convoluted and fragmented governance , the arms races of the previous decades , previous military planning , imperial and colonial rivalry for wealth , power and prestige , and economic and military rivalry in industry and trade – e.g. , the Pig War between Austria and Serbia ."
"Other causes that came into play during the diplomatic crisis that preceded the war included misperceptions of intent ( e.g. , the German belief that the United Kingdom would remain neutral ) and delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications ."
The various categories of explanation for World War I correspond to different historians ' overall methods .
Most historians and popular commentators include causes from more than one category of explanation to provide a rounded account of the causes of the war .
"The deepest distinction among these accounts is between stories that see it as the inevitable and predictable outcome of certain factors , and those that describe it as an arbitrary and unfortunate mistake ."
"In attributing causes for the war , historians and academics had to deal with an unprecedented flood of memoirs and official documents , released as each country involved tried to avoid blame for starting the war ."
"Early releases of information by governments , particularly those released for use by the `` Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War '' were shown to be incomplete and biased ."
"In addition some documents , especially diplomatic cables between Russia and France , were found to have been doctored ."
"Even in later decades however , when much more information had been released , historians from the same culture have been shown to come to differing conclusions on the causes of the war ."

Subtractive color mixing
"An 1877 color photo by Louis Ducos du Hauron , a French pioneer of color photography ."
"The overlapping subtractive yellow , cyan and red ( magenta ) image elements can clearly be seen ."
"A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes , inks , paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors , each the result of partially or completely subtracting ( that is , absorbing ) some wavelengths of light and not others ."
The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the visible spectrum are not absorbed and therefore remain visible .
"Subtractive color systems start with light , presumably white light ."
"Colored inks , paints , or filters between the viewer and the light source or reflective surface subtract wavelengths from the light , giving it color ."
"If the incident light is other than white , our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well , but not perfectly , often giving a flawed impression of the `` true '' color of the surface ."
"Conversely , additive color systems start with darkness ."
Light sources of various wavelengths are added in various proportions to produce a range of colors .
The component lights may be inherently colored or simply white light that has passed through suitable subtractive color filters ; their combination is an additive one in either case .
"Usually , three primary colors are combined to stimulate humans’ trichromatic color vision , sensed by the three types of cone cells in the eye , giving an apparently full range ."
The mini-DIN connectors are a family of multi-pin electrical connectors used in a variety of applications .
"Mini-DIN is similar to the larger , older DIN connector ."
"Both are standards of the Deutsches Institut für Normung , the German standards body ."
A screenshot of the GNOME Shell GUI .
The Xerox Alto was the first to use a graphical user interface .
"In computing , graphical user interface ( GUI , sometimes pronounced 'gooey ' ) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices using images rather than text commands ."
"GUIs can be used in computers , hand-held devices such as MP3 players , portable media players or gaming devices , household appliances , office , and industry equipment ."
"A GUI represents the information and actions available to a user through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation , as opposed to text-based interfaces , typed command labels or text navigation ."
The actions are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements .
"The term GUI is restricted to the scope of two-dimensional display screens with display resolutions able to describe generic information , in the tradition of the computer science research at the PARC ( Palo Alto Research Center ) ."
"The term GUI is not usually applied to other low-resolution types of interfaces that are non-generic , such as video games ( where HUD is preferred ) , or not restricted to flat screens , like volumetric displays ."
Adapter between a female BNC connector and banana plugs
Audiophile banana plugs connected to a loudspeaker
"A banana connector ( commonly banana plug for the male , banana socket or banana jack for the female ) is a single- wire ( one conductor ) electrical connector used for joining wires to equipment ."
"The term 4 mm connector is also used , especially in Europe , although not all banana connectors will mate with 4 mm parts ."
The plugs are frequently used to terminate patch cords for electronic test equipment .
They are also often used as the plugs on the cables connecting the amplifier to the loudspeakers in hi-fi sound systems .
The plug was invented in 1924 by Richard Hirschmann ( former Richard Hirschmann GmbH & Co . ) .
"In Greek mythology , the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans ( Greeks ) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus king of Sparta ."
"The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature , most notably through Homer 's Iliad and the Odyssey ."
The Iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of Troy ; the Odyssey describes Odysseus 's journey home .
"Other parts of the war are contained in a cycle of epic poems , which have survived through fragments ."
"Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature , and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid ."
"The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena , Hera , and Aphrodite , after Eris , the goddess of strife and discord , gave them a golden apple , sometimes known as the Apple of Discord , marked `` for the fairest '' ."
"Zeus sent the goddesses to Paris , who judged that Aphrodite , as the `` fairest '' , should receive the apple ."
"In exchange , Aphrodite made Helen , the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus , fall in love with Paris , who took her to Troy ."
"Agamemnon , king of Mycenae and the brother of Helen 's husband Menelaus , led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris ' insult ."
"After the deaths of many heroes , including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax , and the Trojans Hector and Paris , the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse ."
"The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans ( except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves ) and desecrated the temples , thus earning the gods ' wrath ."
Few of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores .
"The Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas , one of the Trojans , who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modern-day Italy ."
"The ancient Greeks thought that the Trojan War was a historical event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century BC , and believed that Troy was located in modern-day Turkey near the Dardanelles ."
"By modern times , both the war and the city were widely believed to be non-historical ."
"In 1868 , however , the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert , who convinced Schliemann that Troy was at Hissarlik and Schliemann took over Calvert 's excavations on property belonging to Calvert ; this claim is now accepted by most scholars ."
Whether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open question .
"Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale , though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age ."
"Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC , often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes , 1194–1184 BC , which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa ."
"An April 24 , 1851 poster warning the `` colored people of Boston '' about policemen acting as slave catchers ."
"The Fugitive Slave Law or Fugitive Slave Act was passed by the United States Congress on September 18 , 1850 , as part of the Compromise of 1850 between Southern slave-holding interests and Northern Free-Soilers ."
This was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a `` slave power conspiracy '' .
"It declared that all runaway slaves were , upon capture , to be returned to their masters ."
Abolitionists nicknamed it the `` Bloodhound Law '' for the dogs that were used to track down runaway slaves .
"Crystallization is the ( natural or artificial ) process of formation of solid crystals precipitating from a solution , melt or more rarely deposited directly from a gas ."
"Crystallization is also a chemical solid–liquid separation technique , in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs ."
In chemical engineering crystallization occurs in a crystallizer .
"Crystallization is therefore an aspect of precipitation , obtained through a variation of the solubility conditions of the solute in the solvent , as compared to precipitation due to chemical reaction ."
"Thomas Jefferson ( April 13 , 1743 ( April 2 , 1743 O.S. ) – July 4 , 1826 ) was an American Founding Father , the principal author of the Declaration of Independence ( 1776 ) and the third President of the United States ( 1801–1809 ) ."
"At the beginning of the American Revolution , he served in the Continental Congress , representing Virginia and then served as a wartime Governor of Virginia ( 1779–1781 ) ."
"Just after the war ended , from mid-1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat , stationed in Paris ."
"In May 1785 , he became the United States Minister to France ."
Jefferson was the first United States Secretary of State ( 1790–1793 ) serving under President George Washington .
"With his close friend James Madison he organized the Democratic-Republican Party , and subsequently resigned from Washington 's cabinet ."
"Elected Vice President in 1796 , when he came in second to John Adams of the Federalists , Jefferson opposed Adams and with Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions , which attempted to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts ."
"Elected president in what Jefferson called the Revolution of 1800 , he oversaw the purchase of the vast Louisiana Territory from France ( 1803 ) , and sent the Lewis and Clark Expedition ( 1804–1806 ) to explore the new west ."
"His second term was beset with troubles at home , such as the failed treason trial of his former Vice President Aaron Burr ."
"With escalating trouble with Britain who was challenging American neutrality and threatening shipping at sea , he tried economic warfare with his embargo laws which only damaged American trade ."
"In 1803 , President Jefferson initiated a process of Indian tribal removal and relocation to the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi River , in order to open lands for eventual American settlers ."
"A leader in the Enlightenment , Jefferson was a polymath who spoke five languages fluently and was deeply interested in science , invention , architecture , religion and philosophy , interests that led him to the founding of the University of Virginia after his presidency ."
"He designed his own large mansion on a 5,000 acre plantation near Charlottesville , Virginia , which he named Monticello ."
"While not a notable orator , Jefferson was a skilled writer and corresponded with many influential people in America and Europe throughout his adult life ."
"Though Jefferson owned many slaves , he opposed the institution all his life and consequently treated and took care of them very well and expected them to work no more than free farmers ."
"Since 1802 historians and others have been divided over the controversy of whether Jefferson was the father of one or more children belonging to Sally Hemings , a slave at Monticello . ''"
Historians are also in disagreement with how much Jefferson was committed to the anti-slavery cause .
"In 1807 , President Jefferson signed into law a bill that banned the importation of slaves into the United States ."
"After Martha Jefferson , his wife of eleven years , died in 1782 , Jefferson remained a widower for the rest of his life ; their marriage produced six children , of whom two survived to adulthood ."
"Though Jefferson has been criticized by many modern day scholars over the issue of slavery , he remains rated as one of the greatest U.S. presidents ."
"The Free Soil Party was a short-lived political party in the United States active in the 1848 and 1852 presidential elections , and in some state elections ."
"Founded in Buffalo , New York , it was a third party and a single-issue party that largely appealed to and drew its greatest strength from New York State ."
The party leadership consisted of former anti-slavery members of the Whig Party and the Democratic Party .
"Its main purpose was opposing the expansion of slavery into the western territories , arguing that free men on free soil comprised a morally and economically superior system to slavery ."
They opposed slavery in the new territories ( agreeing with the Wilmot proviso ) and sometimes worked to remove existing laws that discriminated against freed African Americans in states such as Ohio .
The party membership was largely absorbed by the Republican Party in 1854 .
"Steven Adler ( born Michael Coletti ; January 22 , 1965 ) is an American musician ."
"He is best known as the former drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N ' Roses , with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s ."
"Adler was fired from Guns N ' Roses over his heroin addiction in 1990 , following which he reformed his old band Road Crew and briefly joined BulletBoys , which both proved unsuccessful ."
"During the 2000s , Adler was the drummer of the band Adler 's Appetite , and since 2012 , he has held the same position in the band Adler ."
"He appeared on the second and fifth seasons of the reality TV show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew , as well as on the first season of its spin-off Sober House ."

"The assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln took place on Good Friday , April 14 , 1865 , as the American Civil War was drawing to a close ."
"The assassination occurred five days after the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia , General Robert E. Lee , surrendered to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and the Union Army of the Potomac ."
"Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated , though an unsuccessful attempt had been made on Andrew Jackson 30 years before in 1835 ."
"The assassination was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth , as part of a larger conspiracy in a bid to revive the Confederate cause ."
"Booth 's co-conspirators were Lewis Powell and David Herold , who were assigned to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt who was to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson ."
"By simultaneously eliminating the top three people in the administration , Booth and his co-conspirators hoped to sever the continuity of the United States government ."
"Lincoln was shot while watching the play Our American Cousin with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln at Ford 's Theatre in Washington , D.C. on the night of April 14 , 1865 ."
He died early the next morning .
"The rest of the conspirators ' plot failed ; Powell only managed to wound Seward , while Atzerodt , Johnson 's would-be assassin , lost his nerve and fled Washington ."
"Elvis Aaron Presley ( January 8 , 1935 – August 16 , 1977 ) was an American singer and actor ."
"A cultural icon , he is commonly known by the single name Elvis ."
"One of the most popular musicians of the 20th century , he is often referred to as the `` King of Rock and Roll '' or `` the King '' ."

"In November 1956 , he made his film debut in Love Me Tender ."
"Drafted into military service in 1958 , Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work ."
"He staged few concerts however , and guided by Parker , proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums , most of them critically derided ."
"In 1968 , after seven years away from the stage , he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback television special that led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of profitable tours ."

"Earth is the third planet from the Sun , and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System ."
It is also the largest of the Solar System 's four terrestrial planets .
It is sometimes referred to as the world or the Blue Planet .
"Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago , and life appeared on its surface within its first billion years ."
"Earth 's biosphere then significantly altered the atmospheric and other basic physical conditions , which enabled the proliferation of organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer , which together with Earth 's magnetic field blocked harmful solar radiation , and permitted formerly ocean-confined life to move safely to land ."
"The physical properties of the Earth , as well as its geological history and orbit , have allowed life to persist ."
"Estimates on how much longer the planet will be able to continue to support life range from , to as long as ."
"Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid segments , or tectonic plates , that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years ."
"About 71 % of the surface is covered by salt water oceans , with the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere ."
Earth 's poles are mostly covered with ice that is the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice that is the polar ice packs .
"The planet 's interior remains active , with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field , and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle ."
"Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon ."
"During one orbit around the Sun , the Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times , creating 365.26 solar days , or one sidereal year ."
"The Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface with a period of one tropical year ( 365.24 solar days ) ."
The Moon is Earth 's only natural satellite .
It began orbiting the Earth about .
"The Moon 's gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates ocean tides , stabilizes the axial tilt , and gradually slows the planet 's rotation ."
"The planet is home to millions of species of life , including humans ."
Both the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute resources that are used to support a global human population .
"These inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states , which interact through diplomacy , travel , trade , and military action ."
"Human cultures have developed many views of the planet , including its personification as a planetary deity , its shape as flat , its position as the center of the universe , and in the modern Gaia Principle , as a single , self-regulating organism in its own right ."
"Mercury has a very tenuous and highly variable atmosphere ( surface-bound exosphere ) containing hydrogen , helium , oxygen , sodium , calcium , potassium and water vapor , with a combined pressure level of about 10−14 bar ( 1 nPa ) ."
The exospheric species originate either from the Solar wind or from the planetary crust .
"Solar light pushes the atmospheric gases away from the Sun , creating a comet-like tail behind the planet ."
"The existence of a atmosphere had been contentious before 1974 , although by that time a consensus had formed that Mercury , like the Moon , lacked any substantial atmosphere ."
This conclusion was confirmed in 1974 when the Mariner 10 spacecraft discovered only a tenuous exosphere .
"Later , in 2008 , improved measurements were obtained by the MESSENGER spacecraft , which discovered magnesium in the Hermian exosphere ."
North Entrance of Westminster Abbey
"The Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster , popularly known as Westminster Abbey , is a large , mainly Gothic church , in the City of Westminster , London , located just to the west of the Palace of Westminster ."
"It is the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English , later British and later still ( and currently ) monarchs of the Commonwealth realms ."
The abbey is a Royal Peculiar and briefly held the status of a cathedral from 1540 to 1550 .
"Westminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster , as established by Royal charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1560 , which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster and a Royal Peculiar under the personal jurisdiction of the Sovereign ."
"The members of the Chapter are the Dean and four canons residentiary , assisted by the Receiver General and Chapter Clerk ."
"One of the canons is also Rector of St Margaret 's Church , Westminster , and often holds also the post of Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons ."
"In addition to the Dean and canons , there are at present two full-time minor canons , one is precentor , and the other is sacrist ."
The office of Priest Vicar was created in the 1970s for those who assist the minor canons .
"Together with the clergy and Receiver General and Chapter Clerk , various lay officers constitute the college , including the Organist and Master of the Choristers , the Registrar , the Auditor , the Legal Secretary , the Surveyor of the Fabric , the Head Master of the Choir School , the Keeper of the Muniments and the Clerk of the Works , as well as 12 lay vicars , 10 choristers and the High Steward and High Bailiff ."
There are also 40 Queen 's Scholars who are pupils at Westminster School ( the School has its own Governing Body ) .
Those who are most directly concerned with liturgical and ceremonial matters are the two minor canons and the organist and Master of the Choristers .
"In poetry , a stanza is a unit within a larger poem ."
"In modern poetry , the term is often equivalent with strophe ; in popular vocal music , a stanza is typically referred to as a `` verse `` ( distinct from the refrain , or `` chorus '' ) ."
"A stanza consists of a grouping of two or more lines , set off by a space , that usually has a set pattern of meter and rhyme.The stanza in poetry is analogous with the paragraph that is seen in prose , related thoughts are grouped into units ."
"In traditional English-language poems , stanzas can be identified and grouped together because they share a rhyme scheme or a fixed number of lines ( as in distich / couplet , tercet , quatrain , cinquain/quintain , sestet ) ."
"In much modern poetry , stanzas may be arbitrarily presented on the printed page because of publishing conventions that employ such features as white space or punctuation ."
Super Bowl XLI was an American football game between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Indianapolis Colts and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Chicago Bears to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 2006 season .
The Colts defeated the Bears by the score of 29–17 .
"The game was played on February 4 , 2007 , at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens , Florida ."
This game featured two teams ending long Super Bowl appearance droughts .
"The Colts , who finished with a 12–4 regular season record , were making their first Super Bowl appearance since winning Super Bowl V in the 1970 season during the team 's tenure in Baltimore ; they had moved to Indianapolis in 1984 ."
"Meanwhile , the Bears , who posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record , were making their first appearance since winning Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season ."
"In addition , the Bears ' Lovie Smith and the Colts ' Tony Dungy both became the first African-American head coaches to coach in the Super Bowl ."
"In the first Super Bowl played in rainy conditions , the Colts overcame a 14–6 first-quarter deficit to outscore the Bears 23–3 in the last three quarters ."
Chicago posted the earliest lead in Super Bowl history when returner Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown .
"But the Colts forced 5 turnovers , including cornerback Kelvin Hayden 's 56-yard interception return for a touchdown , and Indianapolis kicker Adam Vinatieri made three field goals ."
"Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was named the game 's Most Valuable Player , completing 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown , with one interception for a passer rating of 81.8 ."
This was Manning 's first Super Bowl title after being one of the league 's most dominant quarterbacks throughout his nine-year career .
"The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award ( MVP ) is an annual Major League Baseball ( MLB ) award , given to one outstanding player in the American League and one in the National League ."
"Since 1931 , it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America ( BBWAA ) ."
"The winners receive the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award , which became the official name of the award in 1944 , in honor of the first MLB commissioner , who served from 1920 until his death on November 25 , 1944 ."
"MVP voting takes place before the postseason , but the results are not announced until after the World Series ."
"The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938 , reducing that number to two per league city in 1961 ."
"The BBWAA does not offer a clear-cut definition of what `` most valuable '' means , instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters ."
"First basemen , with 34 winners , have won the most MVPs among infielders , followed by second basemen ( 16 ) , third basemen ( 15 ) , and shortstops ( 14 ) ."
"Of the 24 pitchers who have won the award , 15 are right-handed while 9 are left-handed ."
"Walter Johnson , Carl Hubbell , and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers who have won multiple times , Newhouser winning consecutively in 1944 and 1945 ."
"Hank Greenberg , Stan Musial , Alex Rodriguez , and Robin Yount have won at different positions , while Rodriguez is the only player who has won the award with two different teams at two different positions ."
Barry Bonds has won the most often ( seven times ) and the most consecutively ( 2001–04 ) .
"Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win multiple times ; 9 players have won three times , and 19 have won twice ."
"The award 's only tie occurred in the National League in 1979 , when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received an equal number of points ."
"There have been 17 unanimous winners , who received all the first-place votes ."
"The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22 , followed by the St. Louis Cardinals with 17 winners ."
"The award has never been presented to a member of the following five teams : Arizona Diamondbacks , Miami Marlins , New York Mets , Tampa Bay Rays , and Washington Nationals ."
"The most recent recipients are Miguel Cabrera in the American League , and Buster Posey in the National League ."
"In 2011 , Justin Verlander became the first pitcher to be named the MVP since Dennis Eckersley in 1992 ."
He also became the first starting pitcher to win this award since Roger Clemens had accomplished the feat in 1986 .
"Childbirth , labour , delivery , birth , partus , or parturition is the culmination of a pregnancy period with the expulsion of one or more newborn infants from a woman 's uterus ."
"The process of normal childbirth is categorized in three stages of labour : the shortening and dilation of the cervix , descent and birth of the infant , and birth of the placenta ."
"In many cases and with increasing frequency , childbirth is achieved through induction of labor or caesarean section , which is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen , rather than through vaginal birth ."
"Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50 % in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006 , and comprise nearly 32 % of births in the U.S. and Canada ."
"With respect to induced labor , more than 22 % of women undergo induction of labour in the United States ."
"Medical professional policy makers find that induced births and elective cesarean can be harmful to the fetus and neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother , and have established strict guidelines for non-medically indicated induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks ."
"An alveolus ( plural : alveoli , from Latin alveolus , `` little cavity '' ) is an anatomical structure that has the form of a hollow cavity ."
"Found in the lung parenchyma , the pulmonary alveoli are the terminal ends of the respiratory tree , which outcrop from either alveolar sacs or alveolar ducts , which are both sites of gas exchange with the blood as well ."
Alveoli are particular to mammalian lungs .
Different structures are involved in gas exchange in other vertebrates .
The alveolar membrane is the gas-exchange surface .
"Carbon dioxide rich blood is pumped from the rest of the body into the alveolar blood vessels where , through diffusion , it releases its carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen ."
Grease is a 1978 American musical film directed by Randal Kleiser and produced by Paramount Pictures .
It is based on Warren Casey 's and Jim Jacobs 's 1971 musical of the same name about two lovers in a 1950s high school .
"The film stars John Travolta , Olivia Newton-John , Stockard Channing , and Jeff Conaway ."
"It was successful both critically and at the box office ; ended 1978 as the second-best selling album of the year in the United States , behind the soundtrack of Saturday Night Fever , another film starring Travolta ."
"A sequel , Grease 2 , was released in 1982 , starring Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer ."
Only a few of the original cast members reprised their roles .
"In the United States , it is the number # 1 highest-grossing musical , to date ."
A board of directors is a body of elected or appointed members who jointly oversee the activities of a company or organization .
"Other names include board of governors , board of managers , board of regents , board of trustees , and board of visitors ."
It is often simply referred to as `` the board '' .
"A board 's activities are determined by the powers , duties , and responsibilities delegated to it or conferred on it by an authority outside itself ."
These matters are typically detailed in the organization 's bylaws .
"The bylaws commonly also specify the number of members of the board , how they are to be chosen , and when they are to meet ."
"In an organization with voting members , e.g. , a professional society , the board acts on behalf of , and is subordinate to , the organization 's full assembly , which usually chooses the members of the board ."
"In a stock corporation , the board is elected by the stockholders and is the highest authority in the management of the corporation ."
"In a non-stock corporation with no general voting membership , e.g. , a typical university , the board is the supreme governing body of the institution ; its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself ."
Typical duties of boards of directors include:
governing the organization by establishing broad policies and objectives ;
"selecting , appointing , supporting and reviewing the performance of the chief executive ;"
ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources ;
approving annual budgets ;
accounting to the stakeholders for the organization 's performance ;
setting the salaries and compensation of company management .
"The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization , and with the jurisdiction within which it operates ."
"For companies with publicly trading stock , these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types ."
"Typically the board chooses one of its members to be the chairman , who holds whatever title is specified in the bylaws ."
"The 2010 FIFA World Cup was the 19th FIFA World Cup , the world championship for men 's national association football teams ."
It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010 .
"The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations ; in 2004 , the international football federation , FIFA , selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals ."
"The matches were played in ten stadiums in nine host cities around the country , with the final played at the Soccer City stadium in South Africa 's largest city , Johannesburg ."
Thirty-two teams were selected for participation via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in August 2007 .
"In the first round of the tournament finals , the teams competed in round-robin groups of four teams for points , with the top two teams in each group proceeding ."

Trees are partially self-pollinating and often are propagated through grafting to maintain a predictable quality and quantity of the fruit .
`` What Would You Do ? '' is the title of a song recorded by American R & B / hip hop trio City High .
It was released in February 2001 as the lead single from their self-titled debut album .
"The track was originally included on the 1999 soundtrack of the film Life , starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence ."

The Life soundtrack version of the song does not contain the Dr. Dre sample .
Alligators are known for their large mouths and sharp teeth
"In animal anatomy , the mouth is the first portion of the alimentary canal that receives food ."
The adjectival form is `` buccal '' derived from Latin bucca ( lit .
"`` cheek '' ) , hence `` buccal cavity '' , `` buccal nerve '' , `` buccal artery '' , etc ."
"Some animal phyla , including vertebrates , have a complete digestive system , with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other ."
Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify animals into protostome and deuterostome .
"In humans , the first space of the mouth is the mouth cavity , bounded laterally and anteriorly by the alveolar arches ( containing the teeth ) , and posteriorly by the isthmus of the fauces ."
The following table of United States cities by crime rate is based on Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports statistics .
The population numbers are based on U.S. Census estimates for the year end .
The number of murders includes nonnegligent manslaughter .
This list is based on the reporting .
In most cases the city and the reporting agency are identical .
"However , in some cases such as Charlotte , Honolulu , and Las Vegas , the reporting agency has more than one municipality ."
Murder is the only statistic that all agencies are required to report .
Consequently some agencies do not report all the crimes .
If components are missing the total is adjusted to 0 .
"Costa Rica ( , meaning `` rich coast '' in Spanish ) , officially the Republic of Costa Rica ( or ' , ) , is a country in Central America , bordered by Nicaragua to the north , Panama to the southeast , the Pacific Ocean to the west , and the Caribbean Sea to the east ."

"The Chevrolet Monte Carlo was an American-made two-door coupe introduced for model year 1970 , and manufactured over six generations through model year 2007 ."
"It was marketed as a personal-luxury coupe through most of its history , with the last model version being classified as a full-sized coupe ."
"When it was discontinued in 2007 , it had outlived many competitors that were either discontinued many years earlier or changed in concept to either a four-door sedan or small sport coupe ."
The Monte Carlo endured six design generations .
"The first four ( 1970–72 , 1973–77 , 1978–80 and 1981–88 ) were of a rear-wheel-drive , V8-powered ( V6 available beginning in 1978 ) coupe style , utilizing separate body-on-frame construction ."
"The later rear-wheel-drive generations bucked the trend of unit-body construction , along with smaller engines , that became more prevalent in the early 1980s as automakers downsized their vehicle lines to meet increasing stringent fuel-economy regulations in the aftermath of two energy crises that led to gasoline shortages and skyrocketing pump prices in 1973-74 and 1979-80 ."
"Despite those trends , the Monte Carlo remained a popular seller and even regained the SS version ( initially offered for 1970-71 with 454 cubic-inch V8 ) from mid-1983 to 1988 with a high-performance 305-cubic-inch V8 ."
"Following a several year hiatus following the discontinuation of the rear-drive Monte Carlo after 1988 , the nameplate was revived for 1995 on a front-drive , V6-powered coupe based on the Chevrolet Lumina sedan ."
"It was succeeded by the sixth and final-generation Monte Carlo in 2000 that was built alongside the Chevrolet Impala , which succeeded the Lumina as Chevy 's mid-sized sedan ."
"The Monte Carlo SS was revived from 2000 to 2007 and initially powered by 3.8-liter V6 ( supercharged in 2004–2005 ) , later to be replaced by a 5.3-liter V8 for 2006–2007 ."
"Scottsdale ( O'odham Vaṣai S-vaṣonĭ ; Yaqui Eskatel ) is a city in the eastern part of Maricopa County , Arizona , United States , adjacent to Phoenix ."
"According to the U.S. Census Bureau , as of 2010 the population of the city was 217,385 ."
The New York Times described downtown Scottsdale as `` a desert version of Miami 's South Beach `` and as having `` plenty of late night partying and a buzzing hotel scene '' .
"Scottsdale is bordered to the west by Phoenix and Paradise Valley , to the north by Carefree , to the south by Tempe , and to the east by Fountain Hills and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community ."
"In political philosophy the social contract or political contract is a theory or model , originating during the Age of Enlightenment , that typically addresses the questions of the origin of society and the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual ."
"Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented , either explicitly or tacitly , to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler or magistrate ( or to the decision of a majority ) , in exchange for protection of their remaining rights ."
"The question of the relation between natural and legal rights , therefore , is often an aspect of social contract theory ."
"Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity , in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law , as well as in the Biblical idea of the covenant , the heyday of the social contract was the mid-seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries , when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy ."
The starting point for most social contract theories is a heuristic examination of the human condition absent from any political order that Thomas Hobbes termed the “ state of nature ” .
"In this condition , individuals ' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience ."
"From this shared starting point social contract theorists seek to demonstrate , in different ways , why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up his or her natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order ."
"Hugo Grotius ( 1625 ) , Thomas Hobbes ( 1651 ) , Samuel Pufendorf ( 1673 ) , John Locke ( 1689 ) , Jean-Jacques Rousseau ( 1762 ) , and Immanuel Kant ( 1797 ) are among the most prominent of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century theorists of social contract and natural rights ."
Each solved the problem of political authority in a different way .
Grotius posited that individual human beings had natural rights ; Hobbes asserted that men consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government ( whether monarchial or parliamentary ) ; Pufendorf disputed Hobbes 's equation of a state of nature with war .
"Locke believed that natural rights were inalienable , and that the rule of God therefore superseded government authority ; and Rousseau believed that democracy ( self-rule ) was the best way of ensuring the general welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law ."
The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the United States Declaration of Independence .
"Social contract theories were eclipsed in the nineteenth century in favor of utilitarianism , Hegelianism , and Marxism , and were revived in the twentieth , notably in the form of a thought experiment by John Rawls ."
Sports are an important part of the culture of the United States .
"Four of the nation 's five most popular team sports were developed in North America : American football , baseball , basketball and ice hockey , whereas soccer was developed in England ."
"The four Major leagues in the United States are the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , National Football League ( NFL ) , Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the National Hockey League ( NHL ) ; all enjoy massive media exposure and are considered the preeminent competitions in their respective sports in the world ."
"Three of those leagues have teams that represent Canadian cities , and all four are among the most lucrative sports leagues in the world ."
"Soccer ( association football ) is less popular as a spectator sport in the United States than it is in many other countries , though it has wide participation in amateur and semi-professional levels ."
"The top league , Major League Soccer , continues to grow and has surpassed the NBA and the NHL in average attendance , although it lags far behind in revenue and TV viewership ."
Professional teams in all major sports operate as franchises within a league .
All major sports leagues use the same type of schedule with a playoff tournament after the regular season ends .
"In addition to the major league-level organizations , several sports also have professional minor leagues ."
"Sports are particularly associated with education in the United States , with most high schools and universities having organized sports ."
College sports competitions play an important role in the American sporting culture .
"In many cases college athletics are more popular than professional sports , with the major sanctioning body being the NCAA ."
A newton metre is a unit of torque ( also called `` moment `` ) in the SI system .
"The symbolic form is N m or N·m , ."
"One newton metre , sometimes hyphenated newton-metre , is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to a moment arm which is one metre long ."
"It is also used less commonly as a unit of work , or energy , in which case it is equivalent to the more common and standard SI unit of energy , the joule ."
"In this very different usage the metre term represents the distance traveled or displacement in the direction of the force , and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum as it does when used to express torque ."
"This usage is discouraged by the SI authority , since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton-meters is a torque or a quantity of energy ."
Stockings on a fireplace mantel .
A Christmas stocking hung on a bedpost .
"A Christmas stocking is an empty sock or sock-shaped bag that is hung on Christmas Eve so that Santa Claus ( or Father Christmas ) can fill it with small toys , candy , fruit , coins or other small gifts when he arrives ."
These small items are often referred to as stocking stuffers or stocking fillers .
"In some Christmas stories , the contents of the Christmas stocking are the only toys the child receives at Christmas from Santa Claus ; in other stories ( and in tradition ) , some presents are also wrapped up in wrapping paper and placed under the Christmas tree ."
Tradition in Western culture threatens that a child who behaves badly during the year will receive only a piece of coal .
"However , coal is rarely if ever left in a stocking , as it is considered cruel ."
Some people even put their Christmas stocking by their bedposts so Santa Claus can fill it by the bed while they sleep .
"John Adams ( October 30 , 1735 ( O.S . October 19 , 1735 ) – July 4 , 1826 ) was the second president of the United States ( 1797–1801 ) , having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States ."
"An American Founding Father , he was a statesman , diplomat , and a leading advocate of American independence from Great Britain ."
"Well educated , he was an Enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas , both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser Abigail as well as to other Founding Fathers ."
Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American Revolution .
"A lawyer and public figure in Boston , as a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress , he played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence ."
"He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , and was its primary advocate in the Congress ."
"Later , as a diplomat in Europe , he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain , and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers ."
"A political theorist and historian , Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 , which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government , influenced American political thought ."
"One of his greatest roles was as a judge of character : in 1775 , he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States ."
Adams ' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president .
"During his one term , he encountered ferocious attacks by the Jeffersonian Republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party led by his bitter enemy Alexander Hamilton ."
"Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts , and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war ( called the `` Quasi-War `` ) with France , 1798–1800 ."
The major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton 's opposition .
"In 1800 , Adams was defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson and retired to Massachusetts ."
He later resumed his friendship with Jefferson .
"He and his wife , Abigail Adams , founded an accomplished family line of politicians , diplomats , and historians now referred to as the Adams political family ."
"Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams , the sixth President of the United States ."
"His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times , though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders ."
Adams was the first U.S. president to reside in the building that eventually became known as the White House .
"Joseph Franklin Rutherford ( November 8 , 1869 – January 8 , 1942 ) , also known as `` Judge '' Rutherford , was the second president of the incorporated Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society ."
"He played a primary role in the organization and doctrinal development of Jehovah 's Witnesses , which emerged from the Bible Student movement established by Charles Taze Russell ."
"Rutherford began a career in law , working as a court stenographer , trial lawyer and prosecutor ."
"He developed an interest in the doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell , which led to his joining the Bible Student movement and was baptized in 1906 ."
"He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907 , as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917 ."
"His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society 's board of directors , in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers ."
The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931 .
"Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of The Finished Mystery , a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I ."
Rutherford introduced many organizational and doctrinal changes that helped shape the beliefs and practices of Jehovah 's Witnesses .
"He imposed a centralized administrative structure on the worldwide Bible Student movement , which he later called a theocracy , requiring all adherents to distribute literature via door to door preaching and to provide regular reports of their activity ."
He also instituted training programs for public speaking as part of their weekly meetings for worship .
"He established 1914 as the date of Christ 's invisible return , asserted that Christ died on a tree rather than a cross , formulated the current Witness concept of Armageddon as God 's war on the wicked , and reinforced the belief that the start of Christ 's millennial reign was imminent ."
"He condemned the observance of traditional celebrations such as Christmas and birthdays , the saluting of national flags and the singing of national anthems ."
He introduced the name `` Jehovah 's witnesses '' in 1931 and the term `` Kingdom Hall `` for houses of worship in 1935 .
He wrote twenty-one books and was credited by the Society in 1942 with the distribution of almost 400 million books and booklets .
"Despite significant decreases during the 1920s , overall membership increased more than sixfold by the end of Rutherford 's 25 years as president ."
"Curtis James Jackson III ( born July 6 , 1975 ) , better known by his stage name 50 Cent , is an American rapper , entrepreneur , investor , and actor ."
He rose to fame with the release of his albums Get Rich or Die Tryin ' ( 2003 ) and The Massacre ( 2005 ) .
His album Get Rich or Die Tryin ' has been certified eight times platinum by the RIAA .
"Born in the South Jamaica of Queens , New York City , Jackson began drug dealing at the age of twelve during the 1980s crack epidemic ."
"After leaving drug dealing to pursue a rap career , he was shot at and struck by nine bullets during an incident in 2000 ."
After releasing his album Guess Who 's Back ?
"in 2002 , Jackson was discovered by rapper Eminem and signed to Interscope Records ."
"With the help of Eminem and Dr. Dre , who produced his first major commercial successes , Jackson became one of the world 's highest selling rappers ."
"In 2003 , he founded the record label G-Unit Records , which signed several successful rappers such as Young Buck , Lloyd Banks , and Tony Yayo ."
"Jackson has engaged in feuds with other rappers including Ja Rule , Nas , Fat Joe , Jadakiss , Cam'ron , Puff Daddy , Rick Ross , and former G-Unit members The Game and Young Buck ."
"He has also pursued an acting career , appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin ' in 2005 , the Iraq War film Home of the Brave in 2006 , and Righteous Kill in 2008 ."
50 Cent was ranked as the sixth-best artist of the 2000s by Billboard magazine .
The magazine also ranked him as the fourth top male artist and as the third top rapper behind Eminem and Nelly .
Billboard magazine also ranked him as the sixth best and most successful Hot 100 Artist of the 2000s and as the number one rap artist of the 2000s .
Billboard ranked his album Get Rich or Die Tryin ' as the twelfth best album of the 2000s and his album The Massacre as the 37th best album of the 2000s .
"50 Cent is currently working on his fifth studio album , Street King Immortal , which is to be released in spring 2013 ."
AM-2201 ( 1- ( 5-fluoropentyl ) -3- ( 1-naphthoyl ) indole ) is a research chemical that acts as a potent but nonselective full agonist for the cannabinoid receptor .
It is part of the AM series of cannabinoids discovered by Alexandros Makriyannis at Northeastern University .
"Reputed recreational use of AM-2201 in the United States has led to it being specifically listed in a proposed 2011 amendment to the Controlled Substances Act , aiming to add a number of synthetic drugs into Schedule I ."
"There have been anecdotal reports of individuals experiencing panic attacks and vomiting , at doses as small as 2 milligrams ."
"As the dosage is much smaller than most other synthetic cannabinoids , users may accidentally dose too much ."
Convulsions have been reported at doses exceeding 10 milligrams .
"Caution should be taken if using this substance as it is active at doses as small as 500 μg ( micrograms ) , has a very steep dose-response curve , and tolerance builds up very quickly to the effects ."
"As of November 2011 , there have been no reports of death associated with the drug ."
The toxicity of AM-2201 is still a matter of debate and there may be long term side effects .
"The Archdiocese of New York is home to over 100 charitable organizations , run by many different religious orders , as well as by Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese ."
The following list is being added to and is incomplete:
"George Washington ( – , 1799 ) was the first President of the United States ( 1789–1797 ) , the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States ."
"He presided over the convention that drafted the Constitution , which replaced the Articles of Confederation and established the position of President ."
"Washington was elected President as the unanimous choice of the 69 electors in 1788 , and he served two terms in office ."
"He oversaw the creation of a strong , well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the wars raging in Europe , suppressed rebellion , and won acceptance among Americans of all types ."
"His leadership style established many forms and rituals of government that have been used since , such as using a cabinet system and delivering an inaugural address ."
"Further , the peaceful transition from his presidency to the presidency of John Adams established a tradition that continues into the 21st century ."
Washington was hailed as `` father of his country `` even during his lifetime .
Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia ; his wealthy planter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves .
"After both his father and older brother died when he was young , Washington became personally and professionally attached to the powerful William Fairfax , who promoted his career as a surveyor and soldier ."
Washington quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces during the first stages of the French and Indian War .
"Chosen by the Second Continental Congress in 1775 to be commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution , Washington managed to force the British out of Boston in 1776 , but was defeated and almost captured later that year when he lost New York City ."
"After crossing the Delaware River in the dead of winter , he defeated the British in two battles , retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause ."
"Because of his strategy , Revolutionary forces captured two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781 ."
"Historians laud Washington for his selection and supervision of his generals , encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army , coordination with the state governors and state militia units , relations with Congress and attention to supplies , logistics , and training ."
"In battle , however , Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies ."
"After victory had been finalized in 1783 , Washington resigned as Commander-in-chief rather than seize power , proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism ."
"Dissatisfied with the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation , in 1787 Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention that drafted the United States Constitution ."
"Elected unanimously as the first President of the United States in 1789 , he attempted to bring rival factions together to unify the nation ."
"He supported Alexander Hamilton 's programs to pay off all state and national debt , to implement an effective tax system and to create a national bank ( despite opposition from Thomas Jefferson ) ."
Washington proclaimed the United States neutral in the wars raging in Europe after 1793 .
"He avoided war with Great Britain and guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795 , despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians ."
"Although never officially joining the Federalist Party , he supported its programs ."
"Washington 's Farewell Address was an influential primer on republican virtue and a warning against partisanship , sectionalism , and involvement in foreign wars ."
"He retired from the presidency in 1797 and returned to his home , Mount Vernon , and his domestic life where he managed a variety of enterprises ."
He freed all his slaves by his final will .
Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power .
"He sought to use the national government to preserve liberty , improve infrastructure , open the western lands , promote commerce , found a permanent capital , reduce regional tensions and promote a spirit of American nationalism ."
"At his death , Washington was eulogized as `` first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen '' by Henry Lee ."
"The Federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years , the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the Washington Monument ."
"As the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history , Washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism , especially in France and Latin America ."

People roller skating
Roller skating is the traveling on surfaces with roller skates .
"It is a form of recreational activity as well as a sport , and can also be a form of transportation ."
"Skates generally come in three basic varieties : quad roller skates , inline skates or blades and tri-skates , though some have experimented with a single-wheeled `` quintessence skate '' or other variations on the basic skate design ."
"In America , this hobby was most popular in the 1970s and the 1990s ."
"Great Falls is a town in Chester County , South Carolina , United States ."
"The population was 1,979 at the 2010 census ."

"Justinian I ( ) ( , ) ( c. 482 – 14 November 565 ) , commonly known as Justinian the Great , was Byzantine Emperor from 527 to 565 ."
"During his reign , Justinian sought to revive the Empire 's greatness and reconquer the lost western half of the classical Roman Empire ."
"One of the most important figures of Late Antiquity and the last Roman Emperor to speak Latin as a first language , Justinian 's rule constitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the Eastern Roman Empire ."
The impact of his administration extended far beyond the boundaries of his time and domain .
"Justinian 's reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized renovatio imperii , or `` restoration of the Empire '' ."
"Because of his restoration activities , Justinian has sometimes been called the `` Last Roman `` in modern historiography ."
This ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the territories of the defunct Western Roman Empire .
"His general Belisarius swiftly conquered the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa , extending Roman control to the Atlantic Ocean ."
"Subsequently Belisarius , Narses , and other generals conquered the Ostrogothic Kingdom , restoring Dalmatia , Sicily , Italy , and Rome to the Empire after more than half a century of barbarian control ."
"The prefect Liberius reclaimed most of southern Iberia , establishing the province of Spania ."
"These campaigns re-established Roman control over the western Mediterranean , increasing the Empire 's annual revenue by over a million solidi ."
"During his reign Justinian also subdued the Tzani , a people on the east coast of the Black Sea that had never been under Roman rule before ."
"A still more resonant aspect of his legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law , the Corpus Juris Civilis , which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states ."
This work was carried out primarily by his quaestor Tribonian .
"His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture , and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia , which was to be the center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity for many centuries ."
A devastating outbreak of bubonic plague ( see Plague of Justinian ) in the early 540s marked the end of an age of splendour .
The Empire entered a period of territorial decline not to be reversed until the 9th century .
Procopius provides the primary source for the history of Justinian 's reign .
"The Syriac chronicle of John of Ephesus , which does not survive , was used as a source for later chronicles , contributing many additional details of value ."
"Both historians became very bitter towards Justinian and his empress , Theodora ."

Context-dependent memory refers to improved recall of specific episodes or information when the context present at encoding and retrieval are the same .
One particularly common example of context-dependence at work occurs when an individual has lost an item ( e.g . lost car keys ) in an unknown location .
"Typically , people try to systematically `` retrace their steps '' to determine all of the possible places where the item might be located ."
"Based on the role that context plays in determining recall , it is not at all surprising that individuals often quite easily discover the lost item upon returning to the correct context ."
This example best describes the concept of context-dependent forgetting .
"However , the research literature on context-dependent memory describes a number of different types of contextual information that may affect recall such as environmental context-dependent memory , state-dependent learning , cognitive context-dependent memory and mood-congruent memory ."
"Research has also shown that context-dependence may play an important role in numerous situations , such as memory for studied material , or events that have occurred following the consumption of alcohol or drugs ."

A platter with cheese and garnishes
Wheels of Gouda
Cheese is a generic term for a diverse group of milk-based food products .
"Cheese is produced in wide-ranging flavors , textures , and forms ."
"Cheese consists of proteins and fat from milk , usually the milk of cows , buffalo , goats , or sheep ."
It is produced by coagulation of the milk protein casein .
"Typically , the milk is acidified and addition of the enzyme rennet causes coagulation ."
The solids are separated and pressed into final form .
Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout .
Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature .
Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced .
"Their styles , textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk ( including the animal 's diet ) , whether they have been pasteurized , the butterfat content , the bacteria and mold , the processing , and aging ."
"Herbs , spices , or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents ."
"The yellow to red color of many cheeses , such as Red Leicester , is normally formed from adding annatto ."
"For a few cheeses , the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice ."
"Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria , which turn milk sugars into lactic acid , then the addition of rennet completes the curdling ."
"Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available ; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei , but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family ."
"Cheese is valued for its portability , long life , and high content of fat , protein , calcium , and phosphorus ."
"Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk , although how long a cheese will keep may depend on the type of cheese ; labels on packets of cheese often claim that a cheese should be consumed within three to five days of opening ."
"Generally speaking , hard cheeses last longer than soft cheeses , such as Brie or goat 's milk cheese ."
"Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher , lower-priced milk , and lower shipping costs ."
"The long storage life of some cheese , especially if it is encased in a protective rind , allows selling when markets are favorable ."
"Additional ingredients may be added to some cheeses , such as black peppers , garlic , chives or cranberries ."
A specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a cheesemonger .
"To become an expert in this field , like wine or cooking , requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience ."
"This position is typically responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory ; selecting the cheese menu , purchasing , receiving , storage , and ripening ."

Geographic distribution of different keyboard layouts in Europe:
A QWERTY keyboard on a laptop computer
QWERTY ( ) is the most common modern-day keyboard layout .
The name comes from the first six keys appearing on the top left letter row of the keyboard and read from left to right : Q-W-E-R-T-Y .
The QWERTY design is based on a layout created for the Sholes and Glidden typewriter and sold to Remington in 1873 .
"It became popular with the success of the Remington No . 2 of 1878 , and remains in use on electronic keyboards due to the network effect of a standard layout and a belief that alternatives fail to provide very significant advantages ."
"The use and adoption of the QWERTY keyboard is often viewed as one of the most important case studies in open standards because of the widespread , collective adoption and use of the product ."

The Mergui Archipelago
The Ksamil Archipelago in Albania
The archipelago of Fernando de Noronha
"An archipelago ( ) , sometimes called an island group or island chain , is a chain or cluster of islands ."
The word archipelago is derived from the Greek ἄρχι- – arkhi- ( `` chief '' ) and πέλαγος – pélagos ( `` sea '' ) through the Italian arcipelago .
"In Italian , possibly following a tradition of antiquity , the Arcipelago ( from medieval Greek *ἀρχιπέλαγος ) was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and , later , usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands ( since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands ) ."
"It is now used to refer to any island group or , sometimes , to a sea containing a large number of scattered islands ."
The marketing mix is a business tool used in marketing and by marketing professionals .
"The marketing mix is often crucial when determining a product or brand 's offering , and is often synonymous with the four Ps : price , product , promotion , and place ; in service marketing , however , the four Ps have been expanded to the Seven Ps or eight Ps to address the different nature of services ."
"In recent times , the concept of four Cs has been introduced as a more customer-driven replacement of four Ps ."

The history of the Jews in the Land of Israel refers to the history of the Jewish people in Eretz Yisrael .
The first appearance of the name `` Israel '' in the historic record is an Egyptian inscription of c.1200 BCE which speaks of an ethnic group located in the northern part of the central highlands between the Mediterranean and the Jordan valley and south of Mount Carmel .
The term `` Land of Israel '' is found in the Hebrew Bible .
"During the biblical period , two kingdoms occupied the highland zone , the kingdom of Israel in the north and , somewhat later to emerge , the kingdom of Judah in the south : Israel was conquered c.722 BCE , and Judah c.586 BCE ."
"Later , in 165 BCE , the Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom kingdom was established ."
It lasted 99 years and was destroyed after the Romans captured Jerusalem in 66 BCE .
4-port Ethernet hub
"An Ethernet hub , active hub , network hub , repeater hub , multiport repeater or hub is a device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment ."
"It has multiple input/output ( I/O ) ports , in which a signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of every port except the original incoming ."
A hub works at the physical layer ( layer 1 ) of the OSI model .
The device is a form of multiport repeater .
"Repeater hubs also participate in collision detection , forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision ."
Some hubs may also come with a BNC and/or Attachment Unit Interface ( AUI ) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments .
The availability of low-priced network switches has largely rendered hubs obsolete but they are still seen in 20th century installations and more specialized applications .

"The Parthenon ( ) is a temple on the Athenian Acropolis , Greece , dedicated to the maiden goddess Athena , whom the people of Athens considered their patron deity ."
Its construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the height of its power .
"It was completed in 438 BC , although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC ."
"It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece , generally considered the culmination of the development of the Doric order ."
Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art .
"The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece , Athenian democracy , western civilization and one of the world 's greatest cultural monuments ."
The Greek Ministry of Culture is currently carrying out a program of selective restoration and reconstruction to ensure the stability of the partially ruined structure .
"The Parthenon itself replaced an older temple of Athena , which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon , that was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 480 BC ."
The temple is archaeoastronomically aligned to the Hyades .
"Like most Greek temples , the Parthenon was used as a treasury ."
"For a time , it also served as the treasury of the Delian League , which later became the Athenian Empire ."
"In the 5th century AD , the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary ."
"After the Ottoman conquest , it was turned into a mosque in the early 1460s ."
"On 26 September 1687 , an Ottoman ammunition dump inside the building was ignited by Venetian bombardment ."
The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon and its sculptures .
"In 1806 , Thomas Bruce , 7th Earl of Elgin removed some of the surviving sculptures , with the permission of the Ottoman Empire ."
"These sculptures , now known as the Elgin Marbles or the Parthenon Marbles , were sold in 1816 to the British Museum in London , where they are now displayed ."
"Since 1983 ( on the initiative of Culture Minister Melina Mercouri ) , the Greek government has been committed to the return of the sculptures to Greece ."
"In statistics , stepwise regression includes regression models in which the choice of predictive variables is carried out by an automatic procedure ."
"Usually , this takes the form of a sequence of F-tests , but other techniques are possible , such as t-tests , adjusted R-square , Akaike information criterion , Bayesian information criterion , Mallows 's Cp , or false discovery rate ."
The frequent practice of fitting the final selected model followed by reporting estimates and confidence intervals without adjusting them to take the model building process into account has led to calls to stop using stepwise model building altogether or to at least make sure model uncertainty is correctly reflected .
"In this example from engineering , necessity and sufficiency are usually determined by F-tests ."
"For additional consideration , when planning an experiment , computer simulation , or scientific survey to collect data for this model , one must keep in mind the number of parameters , P , to estimate and adjust the sample size accordingly ."
"For K variables , P = 1 ( Start ) + K ( Stage I ) + ( K2 − K ) /2 ( Stage II ) + 3K ( Stage III ) = 0.5K2 + 3.5K + 1 ."
"For K < 17 , an efficient design of experiments exists for this type of model , a Box–Behnken design , augmented with positive and negative axial points of length min ( 2 , ( int ( 1.5 + K/4 ) ) 1/2 ) , plus point ( s ) at the origin . There are more efficient designs , requiring fewer runs , even for K > 16 ."
"Nikkor 28-200 mm zoom lens , extended to 200 mm at left and collapsed to 28 mm focal length at right"
"A zoom lens is a mechanical assembly of lens elements for which the focal length ( and thus angle of view ) can be varied , as opposed to a fixed focal length ( FFL ) lens ( see prime lens ) ."
"A true zoom lens , also called a parfocal lens , is one that maintains focus when its focal length changes ."
A lens that loses focus during zooming is more properly called a varifocal lens .
"One sacrifice of a zoom lens is wide open aperture image quality and maybe other sacrifices , because there is no perfect lens ."
"All lenses ( mainly ( super ) zoom lenses ) is a compromise of features-size , weight , price , focal length range , image quality , autofocus performance , build quality and other features ."
"A hung jury or deadlocked jury is a jury that can not , by the required voting threshold , agree upon a verdict after an extended period of deliberation and is unable to change its votes ."

World map showing the Arctic Circle in red .
Map of the Arctic with the Arctic Circle in blue .
The Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth .
"In 2012 , it is the parallel of latitude that runs north of the Equator ."
"The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic , and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone ."
The equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere is called the Antarctic Circle .
The Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for 24 hours ( at the June solstice and December solstice respectively ) .
"North of the Arctic Circle , the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year ( and therefore visible at midnight ) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year ."
"On the Arctic Circle those events occur , in principle , exactly once per year , at the June and December solstices , respectively ."
"It would therefore seem that the Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the northern hemisphere polar day ( 24-hour sunlit day , often referred to as the midnight sun ) and polar night ( 24-hour sunless night ) ."
"In fact , because of atmospheric refraction and mirages , and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point , part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 ′ ( ) south of the Arctic Circle ; similarly , on the day of the northern winter solstice , part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ north of the Arctic Circle ."
"That is true at sea level ; those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions , there is often no direct view of the true horizon ."
The position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed .
"It directly depends on the Earth 's axial tilt , which fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000 year period , notably due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon ."
The Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about per year ; see Circle of latitude for more information .
"An LED traffic light in Portsmouth , England"
"Traffic lights , also known as traffic signals , traffic lamps , signal lights , robots in South Africa and , in the past , semaphores , are signalling devices positioned at road intersections , pedestrian crossings and other locations to control competing flows of traffic ."
Traffic lights were first installed in 1868 in London and are now used all over the world .
"Traffic lights alternate the right of way accorded to road users by displaying lights of a standard color ( red , yellow/amber , and green ) following a universal color code ."

A state of the United States of America is one of the fifty constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government .
"Because of the shared sovereignty between each U.S. state and the U.S. federal government , an American is a citizen of both the federal republic and of his or her state of domicile ."
"State citizenship and residency are flexible and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons covered by certain types of court orders ( e.g. , paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) ."
"States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign ."
County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state .
"Kentucky , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , and Virginia use the official title of Commonwealth rather than State ."
The United States Constitution allocates certain powers to the federal government .
It also places limitations on the federal and state governments .
State governments are allocated power by the people ( of each respective state ) through their individual constitutions .
"By ratifying the United States Constitution , the states transferred certain limited sovereign powers to the federal government ."
"Under the Tenth Amendment , `` all powers not delegated to the federal government nor prohibited to the states are retained by the states or the people . ''"
"Historically , the tasks of public safety ( in the sense of controlling crime ) , public education , public health , transportation , and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities , although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well ( based largely upon the Commerce Clause , the Taxing and Spending Clause , and the Necessary and Proper Clause of the U.S. Constitution ) ."
"Over time , the U.S. Constitution has been amended , and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed ."
"The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation , with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did ."
"There is a continuing debate over states ' rights , which concerns the extent and nature of the states ' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government as well as the rights of individual persons ."
Debates over states ' rights were a contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War .
The United States Congress may admit new states on an equal footing with existing ones ; this last happened in 1959 with the admission of Alaska and Hawaii .
"The U.S. Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to leave unilaterally , or secede from , the Union , but the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled secession to be unconstitutional , a position driven in part by the outcome of the American Civil War ."
"Lipoic acid ( LA ) , also known as α-lipoic acid and alpha lipoic acid ( ALA ) is an organosulfur compound derived from octanoic acid ."
LA contains two sulfur atoms ( at C6 and C8 ) connected by a disulfide bond and is thus considered to be oxidized although either sulfur atom can exist in higher oxidation states .
The carbon atom at C6 is chiral and the molecule exists as two enantiomers ( R ) - ( + ) -lipoic acid ( RLA ) and ( S ) - ( - ) -lipoic acid ( SLA ) and as a racemic mixture ( R/S ) -lipoic acid ( R/S-LA ) .
Only the ( R ) - ( + ) -enantiomer exists in nature and is an essential cofactor of four mitochondrial enzyme complexes .
Endogenously synthesized RLA is essential for aerobic metabolism .
Both RLA and R/S-LA are available as over-the-counter nutritional supplements and have been used nutritionally and clinically since the 1950s for various diseases and conditions .
LA appears physically as a yellow solid and structurally contains a terminal carboxylic acid and a terminal dithiolane ring .
The relationship between endogenously synthesized ( enzyme–bound ) RLA and administered free RLA or R/S-LA has not been fully characterized but free plasma and cellular levels increase and decrease rapidly after oral consumption or intravenous injections .
"`` Lipoate '' is the conjugate base of lipoic acid , and the most prevalent form of LA under physiologic conditions ."
"Although the intracellular environment is strongly reducing , both free LA and its reduced form , dihydrolipoic acid ( DHLA ) , have been detected in cells after administration of LA ."
"Most endogenously produced RLA is not “free” because octanoic acid , the precursor to RLA , is bound to the enzyme complexes prior to enzymatic insertion of the sulfur atoms ."
"As a cofactor , RLA is covalently attached by an amide bond to a terminal lysine residue of the enzyme’s lipoyl domains ."
"One of the most studied roles of RLA is as a cofactor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( PDC or PDHC ) , though it is a cofactor in other enzymatic systems as well ( described below ) ."
"David Gray ( born 13 June 1968 ) is a British singer-songwriter from Sale , Cheshire ."

He has been nominated for four Brit Awards – twice for Best British Male .
"The Library of Congress is the research library of the United States Congress , the de facto national library of the United States of America , and the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States ."

"The head of the Library is the Librarian of Congress , currently James H. Billington ."
"The Library of Congress was instituted for Congress in 1800 , and was housed in the United States Capitol for most of the 19th century ."
"After much of the original collection had been destroyed during the War of 1812 , Thomas Jefferson sold 6,487 books — his entire personal collection — to the library in 1815 ."
"After a period of decline during the mid-19th century the Library of Congress began to grow rapidly in both size and importance after the American Civil War , culminating in the construction of a separate library building and the transference of all copyright deposit holdings to the Library ."
"During the rapid expansion of the 20th century the Library of Congress assumed a preeminent public role , becoming a `` library of last resort '' and expanding its mission for the benefit of scholars and the American people ."
The Library 's primary mission is researching inquiries made by members of Congress through the Congressional Research Service .
"Although it is open to the public , only Library employees , Members of Congress , Supreme Court justices and other high-ranking government officials may check out books ."
"As the de facto national library , the Library of Congress promotes literacy and American literature through projects such as the American Folklife Center , American Memory , Center for the Book and Poet Laureate ."

Michael Jordan has won ten scoring titles in his career .
"In basketball , points are the sum of the score accumulated through free throws or field goals ."
The National Basketball Association 's ( NBA ) scoring title is awarded to the player with the highest points per game average in a given season .
"The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored until the 1968–69 season , after which points per game was used to determine the leader instead ."
Players who earned scoring titles before the 1979–80 season did not record any three-point field goals because the three-point line was first implemented in the NBA during that season .
"To qualify for the scoring title , the player must appear in at least 70 games ( out of 82 ) or have at least 1400 points ."
These have been the entry criteria since the 1974–75 season .
"Wilt Chamberlain holds the all-time records for total points scored ( 4,029 ) and points per game ( 50.4 ) in a season ; both records were achieved in the 1961–62 season ."

"Direct marketing is a channel-agnostic form of advertising that allows businesses and nonprofits organizations to communicate straight to the customer , with advertising techniques that can include Cell Phone Text messaging , email , interactive consumer websites , online display ads , fliers , catalog distribution , promotional letters , and outdoor advertising ."
"Direct marketing messages emphasize a focus on the customer , data , and accountability ."
Characteristics that distinguish direct marketing are:
Marketing messages are addressed directly to the customer and/or customers .
Direct marketing relies on being able to address the members of a target market .
"Addressability comes in a variety of forms including email addresses , mobile phone numbers , Web browser cookies , fax numbers and postal addresses ."
Direct marketing seeks to drive a specific `` call to action . ''
"For example , an advertisement may ask the prospect to call a free phone number or click on a link to a website ."
"Direct marketing emphasizes trackable , measurable responses from customers — regardless of medium ."
Direct marketing is practiced by businesses of all sizes — from the smallest start-up to the leaders on the Fortune 500 .
A well-executed direct advertising campaign can prove a positive return on investment by showing how many potential customers responded to a clear call-to-action .
General advertising eschews calls-for-action in favor of messages that try to build prospects’ emotional awareness or engagement with a brand .
Even well-designed general advertisements rarely can prove their impact on the organization’s bottom line .

Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain in both the electoral and popular vote .
"Obama received the most votes for a presidential candidate in American history , and won the popular and electoral vote by the largest margin in 12 years , as well as the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century ."
"This was the first U.S. presidential election in which an African American was elected , having also been the first in which an African American won the nomination of either major party ."
"This election was also notable for being the first time in U.S. history that both major party candidates were sitting U.S . Senators , only the third time ( after 1920 and 1960 ) that any sitting U.S . Senator was elected president , and only the second time that the winning President and Vice President ( Obama and Biden ) were both sitting U.S . Senators ."
This was also the first election since 1952 in which neither of the major parties ' nominees was the incumbent President or Vice President .
"Chris Cornell ( born Christopher John Boyle ; July 20 , 1964 ) is an American rock musician best known as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for Soundgarden and as the former lead vocalist for Audioslave ."
"He is also known for his numerous solo works and soundtrack contributions since 1991 , in addition to being the founder and frontman for Temple of the Dog , the one-off tribute band dedicated to his former roommate , Andrew Wood ."
"Cornell 's signature prowess as a musician is generally noted as his 4-octave vocal range , as well as his powerful vocal belting technique ."
"He has released three solo studio albums , Euphoria Morning ( 1999 ) , Carry On ( 2007 ) , and Scream ( 2009 ) ."
Cornell was ranked 4th in the list of `` Heavy Metal 's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists '' by Hit Parader .
"He performed the theme song to the James Bond film Casino Royale ( 2006 ) , `` You Know My Name . ''"
Cornell also released his first live solo album titled Songbook in November 2011 .
Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth 's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation .
"Since the early 20th century , Earth 's mean surface temperature has increased by about , with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980 ."
"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal , and scientists are more than 90 % certain that it is primarily caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation ."
These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all major industrialized nations .
Climate model projections were summarized in the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
They indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further for their lowest emissions scenario and for their highest .
The ranges of these estimates arise from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations .
Future warming and related changes will vary from region to region around the globe .
"The effects of an increase in global temperature include a rise in sea levels and a change in the amount and pattern of precipitation , as well a probable expansion of subtropical deserts ."
"Warming is expected to be strongest in the Arctic and would be associated with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice ."
"Other likely effects of the warming include a more frequent occurrence of extreme-weather events including heat waves , droughts and heavy rainfall , ocean acidification and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes ."
Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the loss of habitat from inundation .
"Proposed policy responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , and possible future geoengineering ."
"Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic ( i.e. , human-induced ) climate change ."
Parties to the UNFCCC have adopted a range of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to assist in adaptation to global warming .
"Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required , and that future global warming should be limited to below relative to the pre-industrial level ."
Reports published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Energy Agency suggest that efforts as of the early 21st century to reduce emissions may be inadequate to meet the UNFCCC 's target .
"RAID ( redundant array of independent disks , originally redundant array of inexpensive disks ) is a storage technology that combines multiple disk drive components into a logical unit ."
"Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways called `` RAID levels '' , depending on the level of redundancy and performance required ."
"The term `` RAID '' was first defined by David Patterson , Garth A. Gibson , and Randy Katz at the University of California , Berkeley in 1987 ."
Marketers representing industry RAID manufacturers later attempted to reinvent the term to describe a redundant array of independent disks as a means of disassociating a low-cost expectation from RAID technology .
RAID is now used as an umbrella term for computer data storage schemes that can divide and replicate data among multiple physical drives : RAID is an example of storage virtualization and the array can be accessed by the operating system as one single drive .
"The different schemes or architectures are named by the word RAID followed by a number ( e.g . RAID 0 , RAID 1 ) ."
"Each scheme provides a different balance between the key goals : reliability and availability , performance and capacity ."
"RAID levels greater than RAID 0 provide protection against unrecoverable ( sector ) read errors , as well as whole disk failure ."
Saint Lucia ( ) is a sovereign island country in the eastern Caribbean Sea on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean .
"Part of the Lesser Antilles , it is located north/northeast of the island of Saint Vincent , northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique ."
"It covers a land area of 617 km2 ( 238.23 sq mi ) and has a population of 174,000 ( 2010 ) ."
Its capital is Castries .
"One of the Windward Islands , Saint Lucia was named after Saint Lucy of Syracuse by the French , the island 's first European colonizers ."
They signed a treaty with the native Carib people in 1660 .
"England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667 ; in ensuing years , it was at war with France 14 times and rule of the island changed frequently ( it was seven times each ruled by the French and British ) ."
"In 1814 , the British took definitive control of the island ."
"Because it switched so often between British and French control , Saint Lucia was also known as the `` Helen of the West Indies '' ."
Saint Lucia has a legal system based on English common law .
The judiciary is independent and conducts generally fair public trials .
"The financial sector has weathered the global financial crisis , but the recession has hurt tourism ."
Representative government came about in 1924 ( with universal suffrage from 1953 ) .
"From 1958 to 1962 , the island was a member of the Federation of the West Indies ."
"On 22 February 1979 , Saint Lucia became an independent state of the Commonwealth of Nations associated with the United Kingdom ."
The island nation celebrates this every year with a public holiday .
It is also a member of la Francophonie .
