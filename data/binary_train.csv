"Due to the effects of COVID-19, the fourth quarter of FY20 (March 2020– May 2020) resulted in lower than normal production, impacting the final measurement year of our FY20 targets.",0
"To help enable measurement consistency and avoid the inevitable artificial reductions in performance metrics during this unprecedented time, we have adjusted Q4 performance figures for the targets that were most impacted (carbon, waste, and water).",0
These Q4 adjustments generally reflect an FY20 Q3 trailing 12-month view of performance and provide a more conservative view of where we landed on FY20 targets than would be rendered using actual performance figures during the global shutdown.,0
These adjustments had the effect of inflating our footprint to resemble business as usual and were only applied to targets where we were aiming for a reduction in impact vs. baseline (“reduction targets”) and to targets where we were aiming to reach a certain percentage (“reach targets”) that share underlying data with reduction targets.,0
